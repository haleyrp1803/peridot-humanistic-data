# Changelog

## Executive Summary

This Changelog is Peridot’s authoritative historical record. Use it to confirm the current synchronized checkpoint, understand what changed recently, distinguish active work from deferred or rolled-back experiments, and trace the complete reverse-chronological commit history when investigating regressions or preparing a handoff.

The Changelog owns chronology and milestone interpretation, not the complete current architecture or workflow rules. For current contracts, use the Maintainer’s Guide; for process, use the Project Workflow Charter.

## Document Role and Boundaries

This document owns the detailed checkpoint, milestone chronology, deferred/archived/rolled-back record, and full commit history. It does not own broad module specifications, public workflows, or process law.

## 1. Current Synchronized Checkpoint

```text
1810a40 — Replace minimum weight with count conditions
Branch: main
Status: local and origin/main aligned after the latest sync ritual
```

This checkpoint closes the five-pass generalized Search and scope sequence that followed the subject-aware Evidence milestone. Search now reads generalized place assertions, presents neutral generalized Results rather than forcing every record into Source/Target route columns, consumes canonical subject-aware Evidence, aligns Inspector/Analytics/export scope behavior, and replaces the legacy global minimum-weight control with optional count conditions attached directly to structured criteria.

Current architectural significance:

- generalized place search, suggestions, structured Place criteria, Browse, Refine facets, and map-readiness checks use mapped place assertions without inventing routes from co-occurring places;
- Search Results now present generalized Date / People or entities / Places records, while explicit route semantics remain available only where the source mapping genuinely supplies a directed pair;
- Search Evidence uses canonical `mapped-evidence:*` assertions, preserving record-versus-entity attribution while preventing subject fan-out from inflating Browse/Refine counts;
- Search Results and Refine operate on stable applied/filtered data rather than playback-visible data;
- entity/place Inspector dossiers use the applied/filtered scope rather than shrinking with Timeline playback;
- Analytics keeps undated records available by default even when dated records are constrained by Timeline/playback, and its local date controls expose a separate **Exclude undated records?** option;
- export provenance now reports committed structured criteria and capability filters as well as the older direct Search fields;
- the former global minimum correspondence/connection weight is retired from active Search and graph filtering;
- structured Search can instead attach an optional plain-language count condition to a specific criterion—for example, **This place has at least 20 connected places** or **People in these records have at least 40 connected entities**—with counts derived from the loaded/mapped dataset and the primary criterion determining returned records;
- the `Any record text` criterion is still not guaranteed to index every generalized semantic value (for example a partial mapped-place string can require an explicit Place criterion); this remains a bounded Search follow-up rather than a blocker;
- cardinality, Identity, subject-aware Time/Places/Evidence, canonical display labels, and the Home tutorial placeholder remain preserved from the preceding milestone.

The recommended continuation is now a dedicated **generalized Network audit** covering relationship/event scoping, participant-place anchoring, playback semantics, and remaining correspondence-shaped assumptions. Follow that semantic audit with bounded Network implementation passes, including a dedicated node/cluster sizing pass that can consider a small researcher-facing scaling controller in the Visualization workspace. Phase 3 Chart Builder, the no-loss compatibility retirement audit, and deferred Home/tutorial work remain later major tasks.

## 2. Recent Milestones, Newest First

### Generalized Search, scope alignment, and count-condition redesign — 2026-09-07

- **`5e3289c` — `Synchronize documentation through subject-aware evidence`** preserved the documentation baseline after canonical subject-aware Evidence reached Inspector.
- **`e697bd2` — `Refine timeline slider interaction`** refined the Timeline scrubber immediately before the Search generalization sequence.
- **`aabc8bb` — `Generalize Search place semantics`** made ordinary Place filtering, suggestions, structured Place criteria, Browse Places, Refine Places, and map-readiness consume generalized mapped place assertions while preserving conservative explicit-route behavior.
- **`2fd0084` — `Generalize Search results presentation`** replaced the route-shaped Search Results ledger with generalized Date / People or entities / Places presentation. Detailed mapped information and legitimate directed-route semantics remain available without forcing every record into Source/Target columns.
- **`f1a6942` — `Generalize Search evidence semantics`** moved Search Evidence inventory, structured Evidence criteria, Browse, Refine, Evidence-rich capability, and Evidence text search onto canonical subject-aware `mapped-evidence:*` assertions. Record- and entity-attributed assertions remain distinct internally, while per-record Browse/Refine counts are deduplicated.
- **`656010d` — `Align Search scope across Inspector and Analytics`** completed the Search/Timeline/Analytics scope audit. Entity/place Inspector dossiers use applied/filtered rather than playback-visible scope; Analytics retains genuinely undated records by default while dated records continue to obey Timeline/playback; its local date controls can explicitly exclude undated records; export provenance now includes structured and capability filters.
- The audit confirmed the scope distinction: Search Results/Refine represent applied/filtered data and remain stable during playback, while visualization graph exports represent the playback-visible graph and chart export represents charted data.
- **`1810a40` — `Replace minimum weight with count conditions`** retired the old global minimum correspondence/connection weight from Search and graph filtering. The useful analytical idea survives as optional count conditions attached to individual structured criteria, using plain language such as **This person has at least N connected entities**, **This place has at least N connected places**, or **People in these records have at least N connected entities**.
- Count-condition reference counts come from the loaded/mapped Search dataset; the primary structured criterion determines which records are returned. Place-to-place connection counts remain conservative and use explicit directed place connections rather than inferred co-occurrence.
- Live QA across Family Tree and correspondence-style data confirmed generalized Place search, neutral Results presentation, canonical Evidence search, stable Inspector scope, Analytics undated-record behavior, and the attached count-condition interaction.
- One bounded Search follow-up remains: **Any record text** does not yet guarantee inclusion of every generalized mapped semantic value; explicit fielded criteria such as Place work correctly.
- The next large project is the generalized Network audit. A later bounded Network presentation pass should tune node/cluster sizing and evaluate a small user-facing scaling controller rather than hard-coding one visual scale.
- Prepared this bounded core-documentation synchronization against clean checkpoint `1810a40`. The Charter now states the exact-raw-source implementation rule explicitly; the Governance Protocol itself remains unchanged.

### Cardinality, integrated Identity, subject-aware assertions, and Home tutorial placeholder — 2026-08-31

- **`951c21e` — `Synchronize documentation for generalized sample datasets`** documented the first-class sample-data milestone before the next data-model sequence began.
- **`1d34b89` — `Generalize cardinality and integrated identity mapping`** established researcher-declared per-field one/many semantics and delimiter handling, integrated recurring-entity Identity into relationship/place mapping rather than requiring a separate Identity page, and added complex alternate identity recipes while keeping simple datasets on the displayed-name default.
- Cardinality explicitly follows the spreadsheet structure rather than code-array assumptions: parallel columns/rows are structural relationships in the table, not lists that Peridot should zip element-by-element. Structured component dates and separate interval endpoints therefore remain scalar structured units.
- Multi-value delimiter entry accepts ordinary literal delimiters plus quoted forms; user-entered values such as `" "`, `' '`, `"/"`, and `'/'` normalize to the intended delimiter while source cells remain preserved.
- Family Tree sample mapping was refined so former-partner IDs can resolve through stable entity IDs when a corresponding labeled entity exists, while source references without a represented/labeled entity remain visibly unresolved rather than receiving invented names.
- The Family Tree sample also maps a child's birthplace as the mother's **Place of childbirth**, preserving separate semantic roles for the same source value. Live QA showed this can reveal historically meaningful court mobility across childbearing years.
- **`d82e669` — `Canonicalize entity display labels`** made the canonical entity registry authoritative for human-readable labels in Network and Inspector. Resolved references use the canonical display label; genuinely unresolved references remain IDs.
- **`4405f40` — `Guard multi-value place coordinate mapping`** closed the principal Cardinality Pass 2 safety hole: a multi-valued place cell cannot reuse one row-level coordinate pair for every split place. Single-valued place mappings retain coordinate support. This pass also recorded the legacy `customInspectorFields` duplicate-label collapse for the later compatibility/retirement audit rather than patching the old path independently.
- **`3f921d0` — `Generalize place and time subject attribution`** replaced mutually exclusive record-or-one-participant attribution with reusable subject selection that can include the record, multiple participants, or both. Mapping fan-out remains atomic downstream, and participant-specific temporal assertions no longer ride indiscriminately on unrelated participations.
- **`8e69bb6` — `Add subject-aware Evidence mapping`** extended the same subject-selection model to Evidence while preserving current broad Search/custom-field compatibility behavior. Cardinality is resolved before subject fan-out.
- **`c7069da` — `Add canonical subject-aware Evidence assertions`** created canonical mapped-Evidence assertions linked to the existing per-record EvidenceSource, preserving one source interpretation while allowing several subject-specific semantic assertions.
- **`ef1c95f` — `Project subject-aware Evidence into Inspector`** made entity Inspector Evidence consume the canonical assertions rather than re-scraping source rows. Record-only Evidence remains record-level, participant Evidence appears only on the selected canonical entity, and visible-record scope filters assertion projection.
- **`b7482cb` — `Add homepage tutorial placeholder`** removed the floating Home tutorial invitation and added a centered secondary **Tutorial** button beneath the two primary data-entry actions. The button is intentionally shorter/less prominent, disabled for now, and shows **“Tutorial coming soon.”** on hover/focus.
- Live QA across Cardinals, Family Tree, and correspondence samples confirmed multi-value Evidence/place behavior, ID/name resolution, place-of-childbirth attribution, both geographic map modes, and subject-aware Inspector presentation through this sequence.
- Prepared this bounded core-documentation synchronization against `b7482cb` before a fresh-chat handoff. The Governance Protocol remains unchanged because its ownership and preservation rules did not change.

### Generalized Inspector/Identity authority, editable mappings, and first-class sample datasets — 2026-08-21

- **`959d874` — `Synchronize documentation for identity and inspector groundwork`** preserved the `4076e5b` handoff baseline before the runtime/Inspector migration continued.
- **`287ca50` — `Generalize Inspector semantics and participant attribution`** replaced the old correspondence-shaped Inspector derivation with generalized participant, relationship, temporal, place, and evidence semantics while preserving compact/full presentation, linked-record navigation, and central multi-step Back history.
- Inspector QA against genealogy data exposed and then resolved several attribution failures: later relationship participants no longer disappear merely because they are Part C/D; participant-attached dates/places no longer bleed onto every entity represented by a row; and non-correspondence data no longer has to masquerade as directed Source/Target routes.
- The place-mapping contract now preserves researcher-named semantic roles and participant subjects independently. The same source column can therefore support `place of birth` for a child and `birthed child here` / childbirth location for the mother without treating those as the same assertion.
- **`bc37b08` — `Make mapped identity and place subjects authoritative`** completed runtime authority for mapped entity identity and participant-place subjects. Stable mapped IDs distinguish same-label people such as different historical Anne von Habsburg entries, while repeated appearances of one person remain connected.
- Identity authority supports role-equivalent composite identity components. A correspondence person represented by `Source + Source Title` in some records and `Target + Target Title` in others can resolve as one entity when the researcher maps both pairs to the same conceptual Name + Title identity structure.
- Workbook and Inspector regression work also added/strengthened safeguards for null relationship references, duplicate workbook join IDs, generalized relationship counterparts, place subjects, and mapped-information rendering.
- The Data workspace was simplified around the generalized model: the old Correspondence-versus-Genealogy public profile chooser and the separate experimental universal-mapper surface are no longer part of the ordinary user flow.
- Uploaded mapped data can now be reopened through **Edit mapped data** and recompiled from the original uploaded source after mapping changes.
- **`e944e60` — `Stabilize generalized correspondence mapping`** fixed the correspondence cross-role identity-continuity failure. Visible suggested Identity mappings are now materialized into authoritative mapping state even when the user accepts them without touching the dropdown; explicit clearing remains respected. The 500-record correspondence sample verified one Cristina identity across Source and Target appearances and aggregated Inspector scope instead of one entity per occurrence.
- The same stabilization work addressed the severe visualization-switch behavior encountered after importing the larger Maria Maddalena workbook; subsequent QA could move among force/network and map views without reproducing the prior application-freeze sequence.
- **`8290696` — `Add first-class generalized sample datasets`** made sample data ordinary project files rather than hidden built-in records:
  - `public/sample_data/correspondence_network_sample.xlsx`
  - `public/sample_data/family_tree_sample.csv`
  - `public/sample_data/cardinals_1600_1640_sample.xlsx`
- `src/peridotSampleDatasets.js` now defines sample metadata and preserved generalized mappings. Samples use the same parsing/mapping/runtime path as researcher uploads, may be downloaded as source files, and can be inspected as mapping examples.
- Peridot no longer preloads any sample under a first-time user. A dataset becomes active only after the user explicitly chooses a sample or uploads their own data.
- Sample mappings are editable in the active session with the warning: **“You’re editing Peridot’s interpretation of this sample data. Your changes will affect the active sample, but the original sample mapping is preserved and can be restored at any time.”** **Reset to sample mapping** restores the shipped interpretation without modifying the canonical sample definition or source file.
- The former embedded `src/peridotSampleData.js` module is retired.
- Prepared this bounded core-documentation synchronization against `8290696` after rereading the Governance Protocol, current README, Maintainer’s Guide, Project Workflow Charter, Changelog, and retained restructuring plan; the Governance Protocol itself remains unchanged because its ownership/process model did not change.
- Deferred from this milestone: per-field multi-value/cardinality declarations and delimiter handling; richer record-versus-participant attribution; generalized Network place/event scoping and anchor rules; Search place/facet generalization; Phase 3 Chart Builder; the Search and Timeline × Analytics scope audits; and a later homepage/tutorial redesign that merges the current Home/Data entry strengths and replaces the current tutorial pop-up/launch treatment with a static tutorial button.


### Temporal retirement, generalized relationship semantics, identity groundwork, and Inspector legibility checkpoint — 2026-08-19

- **`9fe62a3` — `Synchronize documentation for temporal and timeline updates`** preserved the earlier `2d5e668` temporal/Timeline milestone before downstream temporal consumers were fully migrated.
- **`df9511b` — `Migrate temporal consumers and checkpoint network foundations`** made canonical Temporal Assertions authoritative across Inspector chronology, Analytics/Charts, App-level chronological aggregation, genealogy Timeline readiness, and linked-record sorting while establishing the first generalized entity-network semantic layer.
- **`9cc9d93` — `Retire legacy temporal interpretation paths`** removed `parsedDate` from active source, replaced the duplicate capability parser with canonical temporal interpretation, fixed null/open-bound handling, and removed lexical date sorting. Peridot now has one active temporal interpretation system.
- **`3b3c537` — `Use generalized relationships in search and network capabilities`** and **`ccc2482` — `Complete generalized relationship search helpers`** migrated Search relationship readiness, people/entity facets, relationship facets, structured connected-entity criteria, and summaries to generalized participant relationships.
- **`a24034f` — `Checkpoint generalized geographic network groundwork`** separated structural relationship scope from Timeline-visible event/place scope for geographic People Map derivation. The checkpoint is intentionally incomplete: relationship/event scoping, transparent geographic anchoring, generalized playback highlighting, force viewport fitting, and arrowhead geometry remain deferred.
- The Network audit established that multipart relationships should connect the primary mapped participant to each explicitly mapped counterpart without inventing relationships among all co-occurring participants.
- Network testing also exposed a new requirement for semantically named participant-place associations so the same place can mean different things for different participants (e.g. place of birth versus place of childbirth); that mapping enhancement remains planned after current Inspector/identity work.
- SI1 introduced **`peridotRecordStructure.js`**, **`PeridotRecordStructure.jsx`**, and **`peridotRecordStructureFixtures.js`** as a generalized record/entity-attribution reader. Search/Inspector can now expose mapped temporal assertions, participants, places, semantic relationships, and evidence directly rather than only through correspondence-shaped summaries.
- Live genealogy testing revealed that same-label people can be conflated when the generalized mapping runtime lacks a stable entity-identity rule. Downstream canonical-ID preference alone cannot solve identity if the mapping layer never supplies an ID.
- The project therefore adopted a broader researcher-owned identity model: records and recurring entities may be distinguished by a displayed label, one identifying field, several fields used together, or intentional row-level uniqueness. Multiple recurring entity groups such as People and Places can use independent rules, and equivalent identity components can be mapped across different roles/sheets (for example `Source + Source Title` and `Target + Target Title` as Name + Title).
- **`4076e5b` — `Checkpoint generalized identity mapping groundwork`** preserves the current Identity UI/state plus canonical-ID groundwork in network/Inspector-related paths. The Identity page is accepted as a workable first mapping flow but is not yet authoritative in the generalized runtime.
- Current live QA confirms that the lower generalized mapped-information reader is much closer to the user's mapping than the legacy upper Inspector profile. Remaining failures—such as fathers omitted while mothers appear, place profiles reporting no connected people despite mapped birth places, and genealogy `Unknown` routes—come from old Source/Target profile derivation rather than from the generalized relationship mapping itself.
- Next implementation: move Identity immediately after Relations, then overhaul compact and expanded Inspector profiles from generalized semantics while preserving linked-data navigation and multi-step Back history.
- Prepared a bounded core-documentation synchronization against `4076e5b` for fresh-chat handoff; the Governance Protocol remains unchanged.


### Generalized runtime authority, Temporal Assertions, and canonical Timeline playback — 2026-08-17

- **`858ac26` — `Synchronize documentation for Phase 2 mapping redesign`** recorded the earlier generalized-mapper state before the authority migration.
- **`0fa8925` — `Make generalized mappings authoritative for single-table import`** and **`c600295` — `Make generalized mappings authoritative for workbook import`** moved accepted generalized mappings from preserved UI state into authoritative import/runtime semantics.
- **`358202c` — `Generalize workbook join validation`** aligned workbook validation with the generalized mapping model.
- **`6fd19e0` — `Refine network availability for generalized relationships`** made Network capability detection more consistent with generalized relationships while leaving additional Network consumer/layout work deferred.
- **`ba07895` — `Add temporal assertions foundation`** established the canonical temporal model: original source text survives; partial, approximate, open, mixed-precision, unknown, and inconsistent values are represented conservatively; researcher note columns remain separate from machine-derived temporal structure; and multiple temporal assertions can coexist for one subject.
- **`ac95c13` — `Bridge canonical temporal assertions to runtime rows`** carried canonical `temporalAssertions[]` across the legacy compatibility boundary without removing existing legacy date fields.
- **`ce46f08` — `Derive timeline from canonical temporal assertions`** migrated Timeline derivation to assertion-level chronology, including multiple temporal entries per record, interval intersection, role derivation, and legacy fallback.
- **`2d5e668` — `Generalize temporal mapping and timeline playback`** completed the current user-facing temporal milestone: repeatable user-named Date/Period mappings; one-column or Y/M/D representations; six-column start/end component periods; reusable source columns; relationship-participant attachment; temporal note columns; dataset-derived Time types; canonical Timeline readiness/Search diagnostics; and **Cumulative Events** / **Co-current Events** playback.
- Live regression testing used the Maria Maddalena correspondence workbook, a Cardinals workbook with Creation date + Lifespan, and a genealogy/family-tree workbook. These tests confirmed nuanced partial-date handling, multiple simultaneous temporal assertions, source-column reuse, interval participation, role-specific Timeline controls, and co-current disappearance of ended periods.
- Empty Co-current moments now remain valid empty visualization states rather than triggering the visualization-unavailable screen.
- Historical note: this milestone still deferred retirement of `parseHistoricalDate()` / `parsedDate`; that cleanup was completed later at `9cc9d93`. Optional Approximate/Partial/etc. Timeline structure filters remain deferred if they can stay human-readable.
- Deferred Network follow-up remains separate: consume all generalized relationships where needed, fit the Force-Directed Network to the viewport, and terminate arrowheads at node boundaries.

### Progressive universal upload redesign and Review checkpoint — 2026-08-08

- **`e10c062` — `Synchronize documentation for universal data phase 1`** closed the Phase 1 documentation cycle before Phase 2 implementation began.
- **`7588269` — `Add universal upload workflow prototype`**, **`157574e` — `Add editable universal mapping suggestions`**, **`3153861` — `Make universal sheet purposes operational`**, **`8b52af6` — `Add repeated data orientation mapping`**, **`2d96b1a` — `Add operational related sheet connections`**, and **`3b30367` — `Add reversible universal mapping edits`** built the intentionally complete experimental mapper and reversible mapping state.
- Human testing showed that the experimental shell exposed internal architecture as a logic puzzle. The project changed direction: reuse the existing production role-mapper shell and generalize its human-facing grammar instead of polishing a separate six-step universal UI.
- **`050e3ed` — `Mount universal mapper for interactive testing`** established the production test surface for that redesign.
- **`cc43c9e` — `Improve upload data preview`**, **`14f48cb` — `Add upload table orientation guidance`**, and **`fb400db` — `Fix time examples for row-oriented tables`** established source-faithful Preview behavior plus orientation-aware downstream mapping/examples.
- **`0aa0c21` — `Improve temporal data mapping workflow`** simplified Time to Date, Beginning date, and Ending date with plain-language guidance and source examples.
- **`90a3a3b` — `Generalize place mapping workflow`** replaced point/route user classification with repeatable Place A/B/C mappings, per-place role source, optional coordinates, and workbook parity.
- **`967b293` — `Generalize relationship mapping workflow`** replaced binary Source/Target UI assumptions with repeatable Part A/B/C participants, per-part roles, optional relationship metadata, and workbook parity.
- **`0ae7e03` — `Refine evidence mapping workflow`** retained the successful Include/Ignore Evidence model, added source examples/readability improvements, and prevented structurally mapped fields from being duplicated as Evidence.
- **`134c67c` — `Refine upload review checkpoint`** made Review a summary + validation + correction checkpoint, repeated user assignments, collapsed point/route map readiness into one **Map** status, and stopped missing legacy Source/Target concepts from overriding accepted generalized place/relationship mappings in the Review presentation.
- The remaining warning system still contains legacy correspondence/workbook assumptions. That audit is intentionally deferred until generalized mappings are authoritative in the runtime.
- Prepared this bounded core-documentation synchronization against `134c67c` before moving the authoritative-runtime work to a fresh conversation.


### Universal mapping/source foundation and runtime compatibility boundary — 2026-08-07

- Completed Phase 1 of the universal data architecture without changing the public upload UI or current chart-builder UI.
- **`a05130f` — `Add universal mapping schema foundation`** added user-owned saved variables, field assignments, sheet-purpose assignments, repeated-heading groups, and table-connection definitions to the canonical dataset vocabulary.
- **`eda0b88` — `Add generalized source sheet model`** added stable source-file, source-table, and source-field descriptors plus workbook/source-manifest helpers without duplicating complete workbook content inside each canonical dataset.
- **`ebcd7d0` — `Add universal transformation helpers`** added deterministic field preservation, repeated-heading conversion, transpose, and non-flattening table-connection operations while retaining provenance.
- **`301a1e1` — `Add universal runtime compatibility boundary`** proved that correspondence remains on the canonical-through-legacy adapter path, genealogy remains on its direct canonical runtime path, and stock-price/Alaskan-airfield/Maria-style universal structures can remain valid canonical-only datasets rather than being forced into a legacy row shape.
- The fixtures deliberately use varied real research-data shapes as architecture tests rather than encoding stock prices, Alaska, or Maria Maddalena as special-case domain logic.
- Phase 2 is reserved for the progressive human-readable universal upload/mapping workflow; Phase 3 is reserved for the direct-variable and structured scholarly-sentence chart builder.
- Prepared this bounded Phase 1 core-documentation synchronization against `301a1e1`; no source behavior, upload UI, chart behavior, CSS, or runtime wiring is changed by the documentation pass.
- Recorded the Peridot delivery convention requested during Phase 1: coding and documentation replacements should default to one uniquely versioned ZIP bundle with transparent PowerShell extract/copy commands.

### Canonical normalization, correspondence parity, and active genealogy imports — 2026-07-24

- Implemented the canonical normalized research model planned after `619bab0`, including serializable entities, places, records, events, relationships, participations, evidence sources, assertions, temporal assertions, provenance, validation, and deterministic canonical IDs.
- Added the correspondence normalization profile and legacy compatibility adapter, then used shadow comparison to verify parity before switching correspondence imports to the canonical source while retaining the established runtime arrays for current consumers.
- The repository log confirms the canonical-model foundation sequence as **`3aaee49` — `Add normalized data model foundations`** followed by **`d612c3e` — `Add normalized data model foundations`**, then **`1e17596` — `Add correspondence normalization profile`**, **`6c04e84` — `Add normalized model compatibility adapter`**, **`53c1116` — `Add normalization shadow comparison`**, and **`ba844cc` — `Switch imports to canonical normalization source`**. The two foundation commits are preserved separately because Git records them as distinct commits with the same message; this documentation does not collapse or reinterpret them.
- **`402336f` — `Add genealogy normalization profile`** added person-centered canonical normalization for people, life events, parent/partner relationships, places, attributes, evidence, and provenance without converting life-event locations into false movement routes.
- **`94b9d46` — `Add dataset profile selection and routing`**, **`1e661da` — `Add genealogy mapping schema and validation`**, **`2ef36a6` — `Add genealogy mapping workflow`**, and **`8f19997` — `Activate canonical genealogy imports`** moved genealogy from schema/profile groundwork to an active import path.
- Correspondence and Genealogy are now active profiles over the canonical architecture. They remain valuable specialized presets/normalizers and should not be removed merely because broader universal mapping is under development.

### First-time tutorial framework, flow redesign, and stable attention baseline — 2026-07-14

- Implemented a complete first-time tutorial system with a multi-step state machine, draggable panels, minimize/restore docking, step progression, recovery logic, keyboard-accessibility improvements, target anchoring/highlighting, and a Home-page tutorial entry.
- Removed the former standalone Start page. The accepted tutorial now begins immediately in Visualizations and proceeds through seven major stages: Visualizations, Timeline, Inspector, Explore, Browse / Apply, Working Set, and Export.
- Redesigned tutorial dialogue around a large centered title, one concise sentence per frame, footer-based Back/progress/Continue controls, and the Adobe Stock Filigree 3 divider.
- Redesigned the Home tutorial card to align with the workspace-card visual system and removed obsolete title/progress border rules at their source rather than masking them with overrides.
- Added interaction guidance across the full tutorial path, including explicit instruction to close the Inspector before continuing.
- Stabilized target highlighting and observer behavior. **`619bab0` — `Restore stable tutorial attention behavior`** is the accepted baseline for later polish.
- Preserved the exact implementation sequence in the full history: `84fe3cc`, `da0a472`, `ed6466f`, `48f680a`, `67fc073`, `783acc1`, `a52b9ca`, `16cf7cc`, `8241f3a`, `297430f`, `d3c3c24`, and `619bab0`.
- Prepared this bounded core-documentation synchronization against `619bab0`; no source-code, tutorial redesign, or animation experimentation is included in the documentation pass.

### Documentation governance, screenshot history, feedback, and stylesheet-import restoration — 2026-06-21

- Added a standing Core Documentation Governance Protocol and then moved it to `core_documentation/` so it is reviewed with the four core documents before every documentation pass.
- Added a Core Documentation Restructuring Plan that maps current sections into their proper long-term document owners and protects historical/technical material during reorganization.
- Refreshed the README screenshot gallery with dated `2026-06-21` current-interface images in `planning_documents/images/`, while retaining and clearly labeling older rail/side-panel-first images as historical records.
- Added the persistent feedback form, including optional-email handling, compact modal behavior, Formspree submission, and a layering repair so feedback covers Visualizations controls.
- Restored missing extracted CSS imports in `main.jsx`, including the feedback-form stylesheet, preserving the established shared → Inspector → Analytics → Search → Mapping → Learn More → Feedback cascade.
- Removed obsolete local `index.css` backup snapshots as a housekeeping cleanup; Git remains the authoritative recovery history.

### Component stylesheet extraction sequence — historical structural milestone

#### Historical stylesheet architecture milestone

Historical checkpoint at the time of extraction:

- **`639e30f` — `Extract Inspector stylesheet`** on branch **`main`**

The completed structural sequence moved component-owned stylesheet layers out of `src/index.css` while preserving the established stylesheet cascade in `src/main.jsx`:

- **`264e8d9` — `Remove obsolete Data workspace stylesheet rules`**
- **`7b9ddf3` — `Extract column mapping modal stylesheet`**
- **`5c0532d` — `Remove residual Learn More global stylesheet rules`**
- **`407becc` — `Remove obsolete column mapping stylesheet rules`**
- **`19acc89` — `Extract Search workspace stylesheet`**
- **`f7e885c` — `Extract Analytics stylesheet`**
- **`639e30f` — `Extract Inspector stylesheet`**

At that historical checkpoint, the component stylesheet order was:

```jsx
import './index.css';
import './InspectorPanel.css';
import './AnalyticsPanel.css';
import './PeridotSearchWorkspace.css';
import './PeridotColumnMappingModal.css';
import './PeridotLearnMoreWorkspace.css';
```

`index.css` was retained as the shared/global layer at that checkpoint. Search, Analytics, Inspector, Mapping, and Learn More owned their component-specific presentation rules. The Search extraction includes the ordered scroll and folio-corner containment cascade; Analytics includes builder/dropdown and reduced-motion behavior; Inspector includes compact/full/Explore dossier presentation; Mapping and Learn More retain their previously extracted visual layers.

The next substantive behavior work is intentionally deferred into two separate audits: Search dataset coverage/scope and timeline playback × Analytics scope. These must not be conflated with stylesheet cleanup.

The detailed records below preserve the earlier `0c5a219` and related checkpoint narratives as historical milestones; they are not active baseline statements.

### Detailed historical milestone narratives

The following milestone narratives are retained as historical records. They remain useful for regression diagnosis, decision reconstruction, and project-development history. They are not competing current-baseline statements.

#### Learn More project-information hub, divider choreography, and Explore folio-containment milestone

- Recorded the then-current checkpoint as **`0c5a219` — `Add Learn More section dividers`**.
- Replaced the earlier Learn More placeholder composition with a public project-information hub that gives project context without making the minimal Home workspace carry long onboarding material.
- Added public creator assets and a compact creator biography with a **Read full bio** expansion path plus a CV entry point.
- Designed the expanded biography as an editorial reading flow: the portrait appears inside the longer biography, prose wraps beside it at the opening, and later paragraphs continue beneath it.
- Added a compact open-source/GitHub resource panel with direct repository, README, Maintainer’s Guide, Project Workflow Charter, and Changelog links.
- Added an AI-disclosure section with two independently expandable companion papers, preserving the distinction between the creator’s account of the project and ChatGPT’s account of its role.
- Added a Tutorials surface for forthcoming research-workflow material.
- Warmed the large Learn More parchment/reading surfaces while retaining legible dark ink and the existing dark-green/cream hierarchy.
- Added Inspector/Explore-style gold filigree dividers between the header, creator/GitHub row, AI disclosure, and Tutorials sections; dividers use dedicated dark-green breathing room rather than consuming card interior space.
- Staged Learn More entrance choreography as a vertical reading sequence: each divider resolves before its following section, while the creator and GitHub cards enter together as a shared row.
- Preserved the responsive creator/GitHub reallocation model: expanding the biography increases creator reading space while the GitHub resource card contracts but remains usable.
- Restored the rounded Explore folio clipping boundary after a late scroll-restoration rule allowed dark inner layers to project through square corners; Explore scrolling remains on the workspace rather than the rounded folio shell.
- Historical code sequence: **`9fbd200`**, **`81f6311`**, **`7a115f7`**, **`2307d5a`**, **`39983e3`**, **`59f7d69`**, **`98cccf5`**, **`795f0f7`**, and **`0c5a219`**.

#### Search/Explore compact-ledger, Inspector overlay, and animation milestone

- Recorded the then-current checkpoint as **`e5f832c` — `Animate Explore workspace transitions`**.
- Completed the Search/Explore Workspace redesign around a compact folio interface for **Build Search**, **Browse**, **Results**, **Refine / Inspect**, and **Capabilities**.
- Refined Build Search so the default page fits in one viewport, removed redundant empty Structured Criteria helper copy, simplified the Structured Criteria card wording, and preserved normal scrolling when users add criteria or otherwise expand the page.
- Converted Browse into compact index ledgers with panel-scoped search fields for people/entities, places/locations, and route pairs; the Routes panel appears only when the active dataset has meaningful source-target route data.
- Made Browse route-aware for point-only datasets so point/site uploads show entity and location indexes without self-route artifacts.
- Reworked Results into a compact ledger/table model with route-aware columns, point-dataset columns, Inspector-style pagination, 10/25/50 page-size controls, row-density tuning, and descender-safe text rendering.
- Reworked Refine / Inspect into a route-aware facet dashboard with compact default panels, fuller collapsed chip counts, Show all / Show less expansion, row-height expansion that moves lower panels down cleanly, and no route-only facets for point datasets.
- Tightened Capabilities spacing so its default review page fits the workspace better, and corrected the dark-background **Review note** text to use cream/light text.
- Changed Explore Inspector handoff so clicking **Inspect** from Explore opens the full Inspector as an overlay above the current Explore page instead of navigating away from the researcher’s active search context.
- Added gentle Explore entrance and tab-transition choreography: folio/header reveal, left-to-right step-button sequencing, slower content dissolve/rise, animated Refine panels, Results row “page-turn” filing, Browse index-row filing, and reduced-motion fallbacks.
- Restored Explore scrolling after animation-layer testing so expanded Refine panels, Results pages, Browse lists, and criteria-heavy Build views can scroll normally.

#### Data mapping redesign, workbook controls, upload animation, menu, and Learn More polish milestone

- Recorded the then-current checkpoint as **`d04eaf6` — `Hide theme menu entry and animate learn more cards`**.
- Redesigned the column/workbook mapping modal into a more compact Peridot folio workflow: shorter header chrome, compact step rail, Preview/Sheets/Time/Places/Relations/Evidence/Review sequencing, cream working cards, clearer right-side guidance panels, and consistent gold divider ornaments.
- Refined Preview so uploaded tables show a compact file-preview strip and an 11-row horizontally scrollable preview table without the older large statistic cards.
- Reworked Time, Places, Relations, and Review mapping pages so users see role-oriented controls rather than large explanatory stacks, with workbook and single-sheet paths kept visually aligned.
- Rebuilt the workbook **Sheets** step as a two-column workbook-assembly page with primary record sheet, primary unique-ID column, joined-sheet setup, guidance copy, and a compact likely-primary-sheet note.
- Replaced stacked workbook sheet/column selectors on Time, Places, and Relations with combined sheet-column field selectors while preserving the internal `{ sheetName, columnName }` workbook mapping model.
- Kept workbook Evidence grouped by sheet, but simplified default field labels so the sheet name is no longer duplicated inside each evidence display label.
- Refined Review warnings so capability reassurance appears once, coordinate warnings are consolidated, and all warning cards share the same neutral warning styling.
- Added staged upload-mapping entrance animation for the mapping modal, including slow modal/header/step/body/footer reveal and left-to-right step sequencing.
- Simplified step-to-step upload navigation after testing carousel variants; the accepted behavior is an opacity-only step transition that avoids bright cream flashes, lateral jolts, scale changes, blur, or upward drift.
- Removed **Themes and Accessibility** from the visible hamburger menu while retaining the internal Theme workspace mode, component, and routing path for future restoration.
- Added matching entrance animation to the two **Learn More about Peridot** placeholder cards by reusing the existing Data workspace float-in classes.

#### Inspector reference-entry layout, mounted overlay, Unknown-as-place, and record-table capability milestone

- Recorded the then-current checkpoint as **`74db963` — `Refine Inspector reference layout and record tables`**.
- Kept the Visualizations workspace mounted behind the full Inspector overlay so opening/closing the full Inspector no longer reloads or replays the underlying map/network/chart workspace.
- Suppressed Visualizations header/timeline hide-show buttons while the full Inspector overlay is open so those controls do not layer above the Inspector.
- Fixed Inspector related-person navigation from geographic/place contexts by preserving the people-graph fallback through selection resolution; related person and related place navigation now share the same full-workspace Inspector pathway and Back history.
- Reworked the full person/place Inspector from a dashboard-card model into a scholarly reference-entry layout with a lead summary, optional image/placeholder, prose description, compact summary facts, connected places, connected people, directed connections, selected fields, and connected records.
- Refined the compact side Inspector so it remains an at-a-glance summary while using the same Peridot dark-green/cream/gold reference visual language as the full Inspector.
- Added expandable connected people/place/connection lists so high-volume entities such as Firenze/Fiorenza and von Habsburg, Maria Magdalena do not silently truncate at an arbitrary count.
- Treated **Unknown** as a first-class place-like bucket, parallel to person/entity values such as **Illegible**, so unresolved or missing place values are preserved, counted, and navigable where the record metadata can support an Inspector view.
- Updated connected-record tables to support sorting, per-column filtering, 10/25/50 page-size controls, first/previous/numbered/next/end pagination, and date-first chronological defaults.
- Made connected-record table columns capability-aware: relational source-target datasets show source entity, target entity, source location, and target location columns, while point-only datasets show the simpler entity/location form.
- Shifted Inspector wording from correspondence-only language toward generic humanistic-data language: related records / connected records, person/entity, connected places, connected people, and directed connections.
- Updated Inspector filigree assets and divider styling so the full and compact Inspector can use thin unobtrusive gold ornaments without relying on heavy glow/diamond fallback effects.

#### Workspace animation, chart-builder polish, force-network focus, and Inspector styling milestone

- Recorded the then-current checkpoint as **`bd9b807` — `Refine inspector workspace styling`**.
- Added staged entrance choreography for Home, Manage Your Data, Visualizations, Timeline controls, and Chart Visualizations.
- Added visualization-stage transitions that fade the outgoing view into a solid dark-green field and fade directly into the next visualization without a loading label or intentional hold.
- Added left-to-right timeline element sequencing after the timeline bar itself floats into place.
- Redesigned Chart Visualizations as a more cohesive builder surface: muted dark-green side panel, four clearer builder tabs now labeled **Chart type**, **X/Y variables**, **Visible categories**, and **Presentation**, high-contrast inactive/hover/active tab states, one-time guided reveal, and chart fade-in after the builder context appears.
- Applied a consistent Peridot gold treatment to chart-builder cream-card interactables, including buttons, dropdowns, steppers, text inputs, reset buttons, and category controls, while preserving side-panel scroll and dropdown layering.
- Centered the Force-Directed Network initial viewport on the densest network cluster / strongest nearby focal area rather than presenting the whole graph evenly.
- Updated the Inspector full workspace and compact side panel to share the chart-builder visual language: muted dark-green shell, cream information cards, gold primary commands, muted-green related-object navigation, and more restrained passive metadata treatment.
- Suppressed visualization header/timeline hide-show toggles when the full Inspector workspace is open, while preserving those controls in ordinary Visualizations mode.
- Recorded an open Inspector behavior issue for a fresh diagnostic pass: related-person navigation from some Inspector contexts opens the blank state; related-place navigation is working. The failed attempted fix touched `interactionHelpers.js` and `InspectorClusterView.jsx` and was rolled back with a clean tree.

#### Home title-card, map export options, branding assets, and capability wording milestone

- Recorded the then-current checkpoint as **`68f99da` — `add some homepage assets`**.
- Renamed the local source-of-truth folder in documentation to `C:\Users\haley\OneDrive\Desktop\Peridot\`.
- Updated the repository URL in documentation to `https://github.com/haleyrp1803/peridot-humanistic-data`.
- Redesigned the Home workspace as an informative-minimalist fixed-ratio title-card composition.
- Home now centers the app identity around the gilded transparent Peridot logo, a single concise sentence, and two CTAs: **Use sample data** and **Upload your data**.
- Moved detailed onboarding expectations out of Home and into the future **Learn More about Peridot** direction.
- Added and documented the homepage layout contract: the logo is the largest object, the sentence is second-level text, button labels are smallest, and the filigree frames the content without overlapping it.
- Added the selected licensed Adobe Stock filigree to the Home workspace as decorative framing.
- Tracked the larger licensed Adobe Stock filigree set as a future design-reference asset.
- Added homepage mockup and annotated mockup references so future homepage changes preserve the intended proportional layout.
- Added the current homepage screenshot reference for documentation.
- Added gilded Peridot logo variants and palette/design reference assets to `assets/`.
- Preserved `assets/Peridot Logo Workspace.psd` as an ignored local design source rather than a committed runtime/documentation asset.
- Finalized map PNG export options: default output is map-only, with no Peridot branding or extra text.
- Added optional map export title placement above the map image and optional metadata placement below the map image.
- Improved map export annotation readability with larger Peridot typography and tighter whitespace.
- Clarified Data/Advanced Search/Visualizations capability wording: internal capability diagnostics were removed from user-facing review; point and route map readiness language was combined/clarified where appropriate; unavailable visualization language now says the visualization is **not available** for the dataset rather than **limited**.
- Confirmed point/site datasets such as Alaskan Airfields do not incorrectly advertise relational route/network readiness when no source-target relationships are mapped.

#### Peridot logo and home-workspace branding milestone

- Added the user-designed Peridot logo assets to `assets/` as `Peridot Logo.png` and `Peridot Logo Transparent.png`.
- Integrated the transparent-background logo into the Home workspace hero while preserving an accessible hidden `h1` for the app name.
- Documented the logo asset locations in README, Maintainer Guide, and Workflow Charter so future branding passes keep the app and documentation synchronized.

#### Theme, visualization chrome, map palette, and Analytics chart layout/theme milestone

- Routed Inspector and related evidence surfaces through semantic theme roles so color changes are controlled from the central theme system rather than scattered component constants.
- Preserved the Peridot ornamental folio language while tightening visualization chrome, including header tabs, edge handles, map utility buttons, collapse/expand affordances, and chart control surfaces.
- Reworked the Visualizations header and Timeline collapse/expand controls as ornamental, high-layer edge controls so the buttons remain in front of map/chart surfaces and communicate direction without relying on text-heavy labels.
- Added dropdown/portal layering safeguards for chart and workspace menus so expanded menus do not fall behind visualization layers.
- Added a light navy sea map treatment, dark map frame, muted green land treatment, active-land olive emphasis, and label-density/collision polish.
- Added a finite 30-color Analytics chart series library sourced from the approved green, gold, blue, and pink palettes, with greens/golds dominant and blues/pinks used as supporting contrast. This remains the default chart palette rather than a hard lock.
- Documented the color/theming audit trail in `planning_documents`, including color centralization, theme palette, built-in palette, classic itch palette, theme-control, map-assignment, upload-guide, dropdown-portal, and ornamental-toggle audits.
- Refined the Chart Visualizations control rail, dropdown hover treatment, series contrast, and chart workspace surface colors.
- Defaulted Analytics ordered date charts to **Year**, with **Full date** available as an explicit higher-granularity option.
- Hardened chart derivation logic for record counts, part-to-whole charts, grouped bars, stacked bars, multi-line charts, histograms, heatmaps, and year/full-date handling.
- Fixed grouped bar and multi-line count buckets so grouped yearly values use real counts rather than presence/absence.
- Added manual category/series selection across chart types, with compatible settings preserved as users switch between charts.
- Added persistent chart summary panels for ranked values, segment totals, line totals, trend summaries, bin ranges, matrix combinations, slices/shares, and sunburst parent totals.
- Added stronger major and minor axis ticks/gridlines for axis-based charts and kept chart PNG export using the rendered SVG panel/axis system.
- Rebuilt the Analytics builder as a tabbed control surface with **Chart**, **Fields**, **Categories**, and **Present** tabs.
- Resized the builder/chart composition so controls occupy roughly one-quarter of the workspace and the chart area occupies roughly three-quarters.
- Added custom presentation-title support and kept generated chart titles available as the default reference.
- Improved bar labels, metric choices, and chart-method labeling so chart cards communicate axis/measure/hierarchy semantics without relying only on hover.
- Reworked chart-card geometry around a shared renderer layout: left three-fourths for chart marks, right fourth for complete simplified legend/summary rows.
- Removed folded “x more” legend behavior so legends represent every displayed item, then simplified each row to label/value to avoid metadata clutter.
- Tightened chart-card padding and anchored title/subtitle placement near the top of the card while preserving chart/legend scale.
- Restored Bar Chart default orientation to **Vertical**, while keeping horizontal orientation available.
- Scoped chart-targeted palette imports so **Charts** changes update `analytics.series` without recoloring app chrome.
- Routed remaining bar, histogram, and heatmap marks through the active chart series palette so every chart type responds to explicit chart-palette imports.
- Then-current Analytics/theme baseline: **`e50ebf6` — `Scope chart palette imports to chart series`**.

#### Advanced Search / Explore consolidation milestone

- Routed **Explore Your Data** directly to Advanced Search from both the hamburger menu and the Visualizations header.
- Moved the former "what this data can do" capability summary into a dedicated **Capabilities** tab inside Advanced Search.
- Reworked Search into a tabbed research workflow: **Build Search**, **Browse**, **Results**, **Refine / Inspect**, and **Capabilities**.
- Added result cards with compact record summaries, match explanations, capability badges, and full Inspector handoff.
- Added result facets with counts so users can refine current results by people/entities, places, routes, years, capabilities, and evidence fields.
- Added global capability filters for Inspector/map/route/network/timeline/evidence readiness and missing date/coordinate conditions.
- Added dataset-wide Browse indexes for People / Entities, Places, Routes, and Evidence Fields; Browse items fill draft search criteria and preserve the explicit Apply Filters workflow.
- Added structured criteria rows with predictive suggestions and an increased five-row cap.
- Added Boolean structured-search logic with user-facing connectors: first criterion starts the group, later criteria use **AND**, **OR**, or **EXCLUDING**.
- Preserved the core draft/apply model: typing, suggestions, Browse selections, facet selections, and structured criteria edits change draft state only until **Apply Filters** is pressed.
- Then-current Advanced Search baseline: **`d52392a` — `Add capabilities tab to advanced search`**.

#### Structural cleanup, commenting, and scope-contract milestone

- Added developer-orientation comments across the source tree so a new human developer can understand major sections, cross-file responsibilities, fragile compatibility paths, and non-obvious state coupling.
- Added `planning_documents/PERIDOT_CODE_STRUCTURE_AUDIT.md` as the standing structural audit and cleanup roadmap.
- Extracted embedded sample data from `App.jsx` into `src/peridotSampleData.js`.
- Reduced `src/LeftControlPanel.jsx` to the compact Inspector side-panel shell, removing obsolete rail/workflow content while preserving visualization-click Inspector behavior.
- Extracted column-mapping modal static UI configuration into `src/peridotColumnMappingUiConfig.js`.
- Extracted repeated column-mapping field controls into `src/PeridotMappingFieldControls.jsx`.
- Extracted evidence/analysis Include/Ignore controls into `src/PeridotEvidenceFieldControls.jsx`.
- Documented the Analytics chart-extension contract across config, derivation, rendering, panel, and visualization-header files.
- Removed dormant MapLibre preview files and dependency from active `main`.
- Documented the loaded/filter/timeline/playback/export scope pipeline and clamped chart-local date ranges so chart animation does not get stuck on stale time selections.
- Then-current structural-cleanup baseline: **`fcd2e1f` — `Document timeline scope and clamp chart date range`**.

#### Visualization workspace compression, menu simplification, timeline, and export consolidation milestone

- Redesigned Chart Visualizations from a compact chart-picker panel into a large chart workspace with controls on the left and a full-size chart canvas on the right.
- Removed the redundant chart-workspace header and scaled chart rendering so charts fit the available workspace without internal scrolling.
- Added a collapsible Visualizations header and a collapsible bottom Timeline bar, both starting expanded.
- Implemented the Timeline as a compact bottom scrubber inside Visualizations with dual range handles, playback controls, reset/all-dates controls, and playback position controls.
- Changed map legend and controls to start minimized as bottom-corner buttons that can be opened and minimized in place.
- Simplified the hamburger menu to **Manage Your Data**, **Visualize Your Data**, **Explore Your Data**, **Learn More about Peridot**, and, at that stage, **Themes and Accessibility** before the later user-facing menu hide.
- Added `src/PeridotExploreWorkspace.jsx` for combined capability summary, Search access, and Inspector-adjacent evidence review.
- Added `src/PeridotLearnMoreWorkspace.jsx` as a placeholder for future project information, credits, tutorials, and help content.
- Reframed Theme as **Themes and Accessibility**.
- Moved map/network export actions into the Visualizations header Export menu.
- Moved chart PNG export out of the chart controls rail and into the same Visualizations header Export menu.
- Removed the obsolete standalone Export workspace route and deleted `src/PeridotExportWorkspace.jsx` from the active source tree.
- Then-current visualization-workspace/export baseline: **`fcd2e1f` — `Document timeline scope and clamp chart date range`**.

#### Visualization capability and flexible Analytics milestone

- Added capability-aware Visualizations workspace menus for Mapping Visualizations, Network Visualizations, Chart Visualizations, and Explore Your Data.
- Added readable availability labels, forgiving hover behavior, and unavailable-state explanations when a dataset cannot support a selected map, network, or chart view.
- Changed Chart Visualizations so the dropdown lists chart types directly rather than a broad Analytics entry.
- Generalized Analytics chart controls around user-selected x-axis/category fields, y-axis/metric fields, aggregation, grouping/series fields, heatmap rows/columns, histogram distributions, and selected wide numeric series.
- Made **Record count** an explicit metric for aggregate chart types, including histogram and sunburst.
- Cleaned chart language so generic record/metric charts no longer imply that all values are letters.
- Then-current flexible-Analytics baseline: **`ab7affa` — `Clean up flexible Analytics chart controls`**.

#### Generic chart/evidence record and mapping-field inclusion milestone

- Generalized user-facing app language beyond correspondence-only wording while preserving compatibility terms and legacy internal names where still required.
- Added generic chart/evidence row admission so chart-first and evidence-first datasets can enter the active dataset without map or network roles.
- Kept map and network availability capability-based: generic chart records can be chart-ready and export-ready while remaining unmappable and non-network-ready.
- Replaced the Evidence and analysis include/ignore dropdown control with explicit **Include** and **Ignore** checkboxes per field, defaulting to Include.
- Then-current generic-record and evidence-field UI baseline: **`08b628b` — `Use include and ignore checkboxes for evidence fields`**.

#### Data capability and role-based mapping milestone

- Added `planning_documents/PERIDOT_DATA_CAPABILITY_MODEL_PLAN.md` to define Peridot's broader humanistic-data capability model.
- Added `src/peridotDataCapabilityAudit.js` as a pure helper for field-role inference and dataset capability reporting.
- Moved the data capability audit to the mapping-review decision point instead of leaving it as a post-cancel Data workspace status card.
- Reorganized the mapping modal away from **Map Peridot variables** and **Choose Inspector fields** toward role-based stages: **Identify records**, **Time**, **Places**, **Relationships**, **Evidence and analysis**, and **Review capabilities**.
- Added explicit temporal mapping roles for single date, date start, date end, and display date.
- Added point-location mapping roles for datasets with one location per record.
- Added combined coordinate-pair mapping roles for point records and source/target route records, using latitude-first pairs.
- Preserved existing correspondence route/network behavior while allowing non-network point/site datasets to import and render in Place Map.
- Confirmed that point/site datasets without source-target relationships correctly do not populate People Network or Force-Directed views.
- Then-current data-capability baseline: **`e7c3b57` — `Add point-location role mapping`**.

#### Home/workspace visual-system milestone

- Refined the Home workspace layout and menu access.
- Removed Home navigation from active workspaces.
- Applied the Home-style visual system to full workspaces.
- Standardized most workspace button hover/highlight states around the existing gold-brown accent.

#### Dual-mode Inspector workspace milestone

- Added `planning_documents/PERIDOT_INSPECTOR_WORKSPACE_CONTRACT.md` to define the compact/full Inspector model.
- Prepared `InspectorPanel.jsx` as a reusable Inspector content boundary.
- Added Inspector presentation modes for `closed`, `compact`, `workspace`, and `empty-workspace`.
- Changed visualization clicks so nodes, edges, and clusters open the compact side-panel Inspector.
- Changed hamburger **Inspector** so it opens the full Inspector workspace rather than the compact side panel.
- Added compact **Expand Inspector** behavior and `[x]`/Escape close behavior for compact and full modes.
- Kept the most recently used Visualizations state mounted underneath the full Inspector workspace.
- Refined the dual-mode Inspector visual treatment with a Peridot/moss/cream palette.
- Reduced compact Inspector content so it functions as an at-a-glance summary rather than a full dossier.
- Moved linked-letter detail into shared Inspector state/history.
- Made linked-letter source/target people and places clickable.
- Made compact summary tiles open the full Inspector workspace for the same selected entity.
- Made directed route rows open route/edge Inspector dossiers with linked letters.
- Then-current Inspector baseline: **`b24e19a` — `Link Inspector directed route rows`**.

#### Interface redesign and workspace-routing milestone

- Added `PERIDOT_INTERFACE_REDESIGN_PLAN.md` to define the shift from a map-first side-panel app toward a multimodal correspondence data exploration workspace.
- Added internal workspace state and extracted workspace configuration into `src/peridotWorkspaceConfig.js`.
- Added Home / welcome startup behavior and routed users into Data or Visualizations from the landing page.
- Replaced the visible persistent icon rail with a hamburger-triggered labeled menu.
- Promoted Theme to a full workspace.
- Created and extracted full workspace components for Home, Data, Theme, Visualizations, Export, and Search & Filter.
- Added `src/PeridotHamburgerMenu.jsx`, `src/PeridotHomeWorkspace.jsx`, `src/PeridotDataWorkspace.jsx`, `src/PeridotThemeWorkspace.jsx`, `src/PeridotVisualizationsWorkspace.jsx`, `src/PeridotExportWorkspace.jsx`, `src/PeridotSearchWorkspace.jsx`, and `src/peridotWorkspaceConfig.js`.
- Moved Analytics into the Visualizations workspace while preserving compact preview sizing and expanded chart behavior.
- Promoted Export to a full workspace with a live visualization preview preserved for SVG/PNG export.
- Promoted Search & Filter to a full workspace while preserving existing keyword/person/place/route/date/weight controls and predictive suggestions.
- Updated `PERIDOT_ROUTING_CONTRACT_AUDIT.md` after Search and Export were promoted.
- Deferred Timeline promotion; the preferred future design is now a bottom timeline/scrubber integrated with Visualizations.
- Deferred Inspector promotion pending a careful full evidence-dossier design contract.

#### Workbook / Excel import and Inspector profile milestone

- Added workbook-aware staging and parsing for CSV, TSV, XLSX, and XLS files.
- Added workbook mapping helpers that model primary record sheets, sheet/column references, core Peridot field mappings, and unique-ID joins.
- Added a workbook mapping workspace for multi-sheet Excel files.
- Let users manually add multiple joined sheets and choose arbitrary unique-ID columns on the primary and joined sheets.
- Assembled multi-sheet workbook rows into Peridot-shaped records using configured unique-ID joins.
- Let users choose custom Inspector/Analytics fields from primary and joined workbook sheets.
- Displayed user-selected custom fields in linked letter cards.
- Reworked person and place Inspector views into profile summaries with related people, related places, directed routes, date spans, linked-letter counts, and selected uploaded fields.
- Added dedicated linked-letter detail pages inside the Inspector rather than expanding long records inline.
- Fixed place-profile fallback behavior so places clicked from profile lists can resolve from linked-record metadata.
- Removed redundant top-level Inspector fields once the richer profile sections covered the same information.

#### Arbitrary column mapping and workbook-parsing milestone

- Added `src/peridotColumnMapping.js` to define column-mapping helpers for mapping user-uploaded tables into Peridot’s internal field model.
- Added `src/PeridotColumnMappingModal.jsx` as the large mapping workspace for arbitrary CSV/TSV imports.
- Staged arbitrary CSV and TSV uploads for mapping rather than assuming incoming files already match the Peridot template.
- Imported mapped arbitrary CSV/TSV data into the active Peridot data pipeline.
- Clarified cancel/import actions so the mapping workflow is less ambiguous.
- Added `src/peridotWorkbookParsing.js` as the workbook parsing helper for the planned Excel path.
- Removed the ordinary legacy three-file upload workflow after the one-file/mapped-import direction became the active public data-ingestion model.

#### Standardized single-CSV Data Inputs milestone

- Added `src/peridotCsvSchema.js` to define the public template columns, field groupings, minimum record rule, capability labels, and upload tips.
- Added `src/peridotCsvNormalizer.js` to convert the public one-file template into existing internal geography, letter metadata, person metadata, and place row shapes.
- Added `src/peridotCsvValidation.js` to build validation summaries and row-capability reports.
- Simplified the ordinary Data Inputs panel to foreground **Download CSV template**, **Upload completed CSV**, latest upload summary, and concise data tips.
- Added an upload validation popup and kept the same information accessible after close through a persistent side-panel summary.
- Established the database-first upload policy: accepted rows may be incomplete; coordinates and parseable dates are capability-enabling fields rather than upload-admission requirements; Peridot does not clean, standardize, merge, or enforce controlled vocabularies for uploaded user data.

#### Search & Filter implementation and layout milestone

- Implemented the dedicated **Search & Filter** rail tab and promoted it from planning contract to active global-filtering UI.
- Search & Filter owns draft/apply controls for keyword search, person filter, place filter, **Route Filter (Place)**, **Route Filter (People)**, minimum correspondence weight, and date range.
- Predictive suggestion menus appear after at least two typed characters, are capped visually to about five visible suggestions, allow scrolling for more matches, and fill draft fields only.
- **Apply Filters** commits all active filter controls together.
- **Clear Filters** clears keyword/person/place/route filters, restores minimum weight to `1`, restores the full available date range, and resets playback.
- Pre-update status feedback appears before expensive full-dataset recomputation begins.
- Later visual refinements converted Search & Filter from stacked explanatory cards into a compact advanced-search form.

#### Analytics feature and visual-polish milestone

- Added the Analytics side-panel tab with chart previews, chart controls, chart descriptions, and PNG export.
- Added multiple chart types, expanded chart controls, dynamic variable detection, route-place/route-person variables, and an expanded chart overlay.
- Improved Analytics chart hover-tooltip contrast.
- Refined the expanded Analytics view: dark green translucent backdrop, cool off-white text/borders, preserved blurred-map effect, and white/cream chart card.

#### Side-panel and cluster milestones

- Consolidated the app around a shared left-side panel shell with a persistent rail.
- Added dedicated rail tabs for Data Inputs, Search & Filter, Export, Timeline, Analytics, Controls, and Inspector.
- Made the Inspector content-only inside the shared panel shell.
- Made clusters actionable in the inspector, grouped cluster members by place, and made cluster sizing reflect represented letter volume.

## 3. Deferred, Archived, and Rolled-Back Work

### Current deferred Network, Chart, compatibility, Search follow-up, and tutorial work after `1810a40`

- **Generalized Search Passes 1–5 and the Search/Timeline/Analytics scope audit are complete.** Preserve generalized place semantics, neutral Results, canonical Evidence search, applied-scope Inspector dossiers, Analytics undated-record handling, export provenance, and attached count conditions as regression contracts.
- **One bounded Search text follow-up remains.** `Any record text` does not yet guarantee inclusion of every generalized mapped semantic value; explicit fielded criteria such as Place already work.
- **Generalized Network follow-up is the recommended next major task.** Audit geographic relationship/event scoping, transparent/user-selected participant-place anchors, generalized playback highlighting, and any remaining Source/Target assumptions before implementation.
- **Network presentation/sizing should be a separate bounded pass after semantic correctness.** Tune node and cluster sizing, revisit viewport fitting and arrowhead termination, and evaluate a small Visualization-workspace controller that lets researchers adjust scaling without changing the underlying network semantics.
- **Phase 3 Chart Builder remains deferred** until the consumer audits are stable. Build it from saved/generalized variables through structured human-readable controls and the scholarly-sentence/autocomplete direction rather than unrestricted natural-language prompting; retain the wide/transposed stock-price case as a required regression target.
- **Repository-wide legacy/compatibility retirement audit remains required.** Retire only code proven unnecessary and preserve legitimate specialization. In particular, an older correspondence-oriented `customInspectorFields` path can collapse repeated duplicate labels through object construction while the authoritative generalized Evidence path preserves repeated values; do not patch or delete that path independently before the no-loss audit.
- **Homepage redesign remains deferred, but the tutorial entry placeholder is now implemented.** The current branded Home retains its two primary data-entry CTAs plus a smaller disabled **Tutorial** button with **“Tutorial coming soon.”** The larger future Home/Data integration and tutorial-content/polish work remain separate visual/product passes.
- Optional Timeline structure filters for approximate/partial/open values remain deferred if they can be made analytically useful and human-readable.

### Tutorial attention-animation experiments rolled back before `619bab0`

The following tutorial experiments were intentionally removed and are not current functionality:

- aggressive breathing animations;
- 5% target scaling;
- Timeline gesture animation;
- SVG node animation;
- replacement of tutorial controls with real-control guidance;
- animated Inspector close-button guidance;
- animated Browse controls.

These experiments were rolled back because target behavior was unreliable, source-file coverage was insufficient for a robust implementation, and behavior was inconsistent across stages. Future tutorial motion work must begin from the stable `619bab0` baseline and proceed as bounded experiments. The remaining polish sequence is attention choreography, placement audit, typography spacing, semantic keyword highlighting, and a final UX walkthrough. Final visual polish must include an explicit review of tutorial-animation order and timing.

### MapLibre migrated-overlay work paused / active preview removed

The later MapLibre migrated-overlay branch is paused and should be retained as an archived experiment, not treated as active `main` code. The old dormant MapLibre preview files and dependency have now been removed from active `main` in `55a368c`.

If MapLibre is revisited later, start from a fresh branch/source-of-truth audit and reintroduce any needed dependencies intentionally. Do not assume the experimental branch can be merged wholesale.

### Force-Directed fallback issue on MapLibre experiment

During the later MapLibre experiment, Force-Directed was intended to bypass MapLibre and use the legacy D3/SVG force-directed view. That routing was partly established, but the force view still blanked after briefly rendering. Several speculative sizing fixes were rolled back, and the branch was set aside. Future work should diagnose the legacy force-render path directly before attempting new fixes.

### Shared-panel prop rename attempt, after `4a17d1c`

A cleanup attempt was made to rename the old `showLeftSidebar` / `showRightSidebar` compatibility prop path to newer shared-panel naming. This was rolled back because it broke Inspector auto-open behavior when clicking nodes, edges, or clusters.

Future work should treat this path as fragile. If the old names are renamed later, the pass must explicitly test node click, edge click, cluster click, contained cluster-member click, and Back behavior.

### Panel responsive sizing attempt, after `b62c74b`

A responsive panel-sizing experiment attempted to make the shared side panel absolutely positioned at all viewport sizes. It was rolled back because it disrupted the full-size landscape layout and forced scrolling before the map. Future responsive-panel work should be designed as a narrow-window override rather than a universal positioning replacement.
