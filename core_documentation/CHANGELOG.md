# Changelog

## Current documented safe baseline

- **`0c5a219` — `Add Learn More section dividers`** on branch **`main`**

This baseline records the active D3/SVG Peridot path after the workspace-routing milestone, the completed dual-mode Inspector implementation cluster, the Home-style workspace visual pass, the expanded humanistic-data capability milestone, the visualization-workspace compression/navigation/export consolidation pass, the June 2026 structural cleanup/commenting pass, the Advanced Search / Explore consolidation milestone, the June 2026 theme/color consolidation work, the Analytics chart-layout and chart-theme milestone, the capability-wording cleanup, the map-export options/readability pass, the fixed-ratio Peridot homepage redesign, the Data/workbook mapping-modal redesign, upload-mapping entrance and step-transition animation passes, the final Learn More/menu polish pass, and the Search/Explore workspace redesign. The current app is workspace-first around a simplified public product menu: **Manage Your Data**, **Visualize Your Data**, **Explore Your Data**, and **Learn More about Peridot**. **Themes and Accessibility** remains implemented as an internal/development-facing workspace and can be restored to the hamburger menu later without rebuilding the feature. Visualizations use a collapsible header, a bottom timeline scrubber, minimized map overlays, a dedicated large chart workspace, and in-place header export controls. Chart Visualizations now use a tabbed builder, quarter-width controls, a larger chart card, a shared three-quarter chart / one-quarter legend layout, complete simplified legends, anchored titles/subtitles, method labels, tighter canvas spacing, vertical Bar Chart default behavior, and theme-routed series colors. The curated 30-color Peridot chart library remains the default, but explicit **Charts** palette imports in Themes and Accessibility now override only chart series colors, including bars, histograms, heatmaps, grouped/stacked charts, lines, pies, and sunbursts. The standalone Export workspace route has been removed from the active app path. Explore Your Data opens Advanced Search directly from both the hamburger menu and the Visualizations header, while Advanced Search itself contains Build Search, Browse, Results, Refine / Inspect, and Capabilities tabs. Earlier milestones include direct Explore-to-Advanced-Search routing, a tabbed Advanced Search workspace, Inspector handoff from search results, dataset-wide browse indexes, structured criteria with AND / OR / EXCLUDING logic, capability and facet filtering, workbook import, role-based mapping, and the shift from correspondence-only import assumptions toward role-based humanistic-data mapping.
Recent June 2026 visual and interaction polish added workspace entrance choreography and clarified the current Visualizations/Inspector/Charts experience. The Home, Data, and Visualizations workspaces now use staged entrance animations; visualization switching fades through a solid dark-green interstitial; Chart Visualizations use a guided one-time reveal, muted dark-green builder panel, gold high-contrast tab states, and gold treatment for cream-card interactables while preserving side-panel scroll and dropdown layering; the force-directed network initially centers on the densest information cluster; and the Inspector workspace now follows the chart-builder visual language while suppressing visualization hide/show toggles when the full Inspector is open. The earlier Inspector related-person navigation blank-state bug has been resolved by routing person-detail resolution through the appropriate people-graph fallback while preserving the mounted Visualizations overlay.

The most recent completed code cluster replaces the former Learn More placeholder treatment with a public project-information hub and repairs the related shared visual foundations. The current Learn More page now has a compact/expandable creator biography, creator headshot/CV assets, a GitHub/core-documentation resource panel, expandable AI-method disclosure papers, a Tutorials surface, warmer parchment reading cards, and vertical filigree dividers between its major horizontal blocks. The expanded biography may grow while the GitHub panel contracts but remains usable; the portrait belongs to the biography’s reading flow so prose wraps beside it and continues beneath it. Divider choreography is intentionally sequential—divider before following section—rather than synchronous card animation. The same cluster restores the rounded Explore folio containment boundary while preserving its scroll behavior.

The current Data Inputs / import workflow now provides:

- downloadable Peridot CSV template plus one unified CSV/TSV/XLSX/XLS table-workbook upload path;
- permissive database-first upload handling for incomplete historical correspondence records;
- validation/capability reporting and persistent upload summaries;
- a pure data-capability audit helper for Inspector, Search, point-map, route-map, network, timeline, chart, and export readiness;
- role-based upload mapping organized around records, time, places, relationships, evidence/analysis, and capability review;
- explicit temporal roles for single date, date start, date end, and display date;
- point-location roles for point/site datasets that have one location per record;
- route coordinate roles that support separated latitude/longitude columns and combined source/target coordinate-pair columns;
- latitude-first coordinate-pair guidance, including `POINT(latitude longitude)` strings;
- successful point/site dataset mapping and Place Map rendering without requiring people/network relationships;
- generic chart/evidence rows accepted into the active dataset without requiring map or network roles;
- evidence/analysis field inclusion controls using explicit Include and Ignore checkboxes that default to Include;
- arbitrary CSV/TSV staging and column mapping;
- Excel workbook parsing for `.xlsx` and `.xls` files through the isolated workbook parser helper;
- multi-sheet workbook staging with workbook and sheet summaries;
- workbook-aware mapping for primary record sheet selection, core Peridot field mapping, and selected custom Inspector fields;
- user-configured unique-ID joins across multiple workbook sheets;
- multi-sheet workbook import assembly into Peridot rows;
- selected custom Inspector/Analytics metadata from primary and joined workbook sheets;
- clearer mapping cancel/import actions;
- removal of the public legacy Geography / Raw Data / Person Metadata three-file upload workflow.

The current Inspector workflow now provides a dual-mode evidence system:

- visualization clicks open a compact side-panel Inspector for at-a-glance evidence;
- hamburger **Inspector** and compact **Expand** open the full evidence-dossier workspace;
- compact and full modes share the same selected Inspector state and multi-step Back history;
- `[x]`, Escape, and blank-map click close the appropriate Inspector surface and return to Visualizations;
- compact summary tiles open the full workspace for the selected person/place;
- linked person/place navigation opens the full workspace and resolves against the correct people/place graph;
- linked-letter detail pages participate in the shared Inspector history;
- linked-letter source/target people and places are clickable and return through Back;
- directed route rows open route/edge dossier views with linked letters;
- person/place profile pages use a scholarly reference-entry layout with lead summaries, optional image placeholders, compact metrics, related people, related places, directed connections, selected uploaded fields, and dedicated connected-record detail pages;
- unresolved/missing place values are preserved as **Unknown** place-like buckets rather than dropped from connected-place summaries;
- connected-record tables provide sorting, per-column filtering, 10/25/50 pagination, and capability-aware columns: source/target entity and source/target location for relational datasets, or entity/location for point-only datasets.

The current Advanced Search workflow is the main Explore Your Data surface. It uses a compact animated research-search layout with Build Search, Browse, Results, Refine / Inspect, and Capabilities tabs. It preserves draft/apply global filtering, current applied scope, predictive suggestions, route-place and route-people filters, year text inputs, minimum-weight filtering, capability filters, dataset-wide compact Browse ledgers for people/entities, places/locations, and route pairs when supported; route-aware point-only Browse and Refine surfaces; Results ledgers with Inspector-style pagination; result facets with counts; full Inspector handoff as an overlay on top of Explore; and structured criteria supporting AND, OR, and EXCLUDING logic. Analytics has chart controls, dynamic variable options, compact and expanded chart views, higher-contrast tooltips, and a dark green translucent expanded-view backdrop with the chart itself retained on a white/cream card.


The current interface/workspace workflow now provides:

- user-designed Peridot logo, gilded-logo, palette, and filigree assets in `assets/`;
- the Home workspace uses the gilded transparent Peridot logo variant and selected licensed Adobe Stock filigree as its visible title-card lockup;
- Home / welcome workspace with a single concise description sentence and **Use sample data** / **Upload your data** start paths;
- hamburger-triggered labeled menu replacing the persistent icon rail as the primary visible navigation surface;
- simplified public hamburger stack: **Manage Your Data**, **Visualize Your Data**, **Explore Your Data**, and **Learn More about Peridot**, with **Themes and Accessibility** hidden from public navigation for now but retained internally;
- full-window workspaces for Data, Visualizations, Advanced Search, Learn More, an internally retained Themes and Accessibility workspace, and Inspector-compatible evidence review paths, with Explore Your Data routing directly into Advanced Search and Inspector remaining available through visualization/evidence workflows;
- Visualizations workspace containing Place Map, People Network, Force-Directed, Chart Visualizations, a collapsible visualization header, and a bottom timeline scrubber;
- Chart Visualizations redesigned as a large chart workspace with controls on the left and the chart canvas on the right;
- Chart Visualizations now use a tabbed builder with **Chart type**, **X/Y variables**, **Visible categories**, and **Presentation** tabs, plus an optional editable presentation title;
- Analytics chart rendering now reserves the left three-fourths of the chart card for chart marks and the right fourth for a complete simplified legend/summary column;
- chart titles/subtitles are anchored near the top of the card, bar charts default to vertical orientation, and dense chart canvases use reduced whitespace;
- chart export consolidated into the shared Visualizations header Export menu;
- map and network export consolidated into the same Visualizations header Export menu, replacing the standalone Export workspace route;
- map PNG export defaults to map-only output, with optional title text above the map and optional metadata below the map using Peridot typography;
- map legend and map controls minimized by default as bottom-corner buttons;
- Timeline implemented as a compact bottom Visualizations scrubber with dual range handles, playback controls, and collapse/expand behavior;
- Explore Your Data now routes directly to Advanced Search, which contains the data-exploration, capability-summary, Browse, Results, Refine / Inspect, and Inspector-adjacent evidence entry points;
- Learn More about Peridot is now a public project-information hub with creator context, project resources, AI-method disclosures, tutorials, and help material;
- Theme reframed as **Themes and Accessibility**;
- Data workspace using the unified CSV/TSV/XLSX/XLS uploader;
- Inspector implemented as a dual-mode system: compact side-panel summaries for visualization clicks plus a full evidence-dossier workspace from Expand/linked-data navigation, sharing selection and history;
- capability-aware Visualizations menus grouping tools as Mapping Visualizations, Network Visualizations, Chart Visualizations, and Explore Your Data;
- unavailable-state explanations for visualization types that the active dataset cannot support;
- flexible chart variable controls for x-axis, y-axis/metric, grouping/series, aggregation, and selected wide numeric series;
- explicit Record count support for bar, grouped bar, stacked bar, line, multi-line, histogram, pie, sunburst, and heatmap charts;
- generic chart/evidence records accepted into the active dataset even when they have no map or network roles;
- evidence/analysis field inclusion controls using explicit Include and Ignore checkboxes, defaulting to Include.

Early MapLibre preview code has been removed from active `main`; the later `maplibre-native-geographic-view` experiment remains an archived branch experiment rather than part of the active implementation path.

## Current milestone notes

### Learn More project-information hub, divider choreography, and Explore folio-containment milestone

- Updated the documented safe baseline to **`0c5a219` — `Add Learn More section dividers`**.
- Replaced the earlier Learn More placeholder composition with a public project-information hub that gives project context without making the minimal Home workspace carry long onboarding material.
- Added public creator assets and a compact creator biography with a **Read full bio** expansion path plus a CV entry point.
- Designed the expanded biography as an editorial reading flow: the portrait appears inside the longer biography, prose wraps beside it at the opening, and later paragraphs continue beneath it.
- Added a compact open-source/GitHub resource panel with direct repository, README, Maintainer’s Guide, Project Workflow Charter, and Changelog links.
- Added an AI-disclosure section with two independently expandable companion papers, preserving the distinction between the creator’s account of the project and ChatGPT’s account of its role.
- Added a Tutorials surface for forthcoming research-workflow material.
- Warmed the large Learn More parchment/reading surfaces while retaining legible dark ink and the existing dark-green/cream hierarchy.
- Added Inspector/Explore-style gold filigree dividers between the header, creator/GitHub row, AI disclosure, and Tutorials sections; dividers use dedicated dark-green breathing room rather than consuming card interior space.
- Staged Learn More entrance choreography as a vertical reading sequence: each divider resolves before its following section, while the creator and GitHub cards enter together as a shared row.
- Preserved the responsive creator/GitHub reallocation model: expanding the biography increases creator reading space while the GitHub resource card contracts but remains usable.
- Restored the rounded Explore folio clipping boundary after a late scroll-restoration rule allowed dark inner layers to project through square corners; Explore scrolling remains on the workspace rather than the rounded folio shell.
- Current code sequence: **`9fbd200`**, **`81f6311`**, **`7a115f7`**, **`2307d5a`**, **`39983e3`**, **`59f7d69`**, **`98cccf5`**, **`795f0f7`**, and **`0c5a219`**.

### Search/Explore compact-ledger, Inspector overlay, and animation milestone

- Updated the documented safe baseline to **`e5f832c` — `Animate Explore workspace transitions`**.
- Completed the Search/Explore Workspace redesign around a compact folio interface for **Build Search**, **Browse**, **Results**, **Refine / Inspect**, and **Capabilities**.
- Refined Build Search so the default page fits in one viewport, removed redundant empty Structured Criteria helper copy, simplified the Structured Criteria card wording, and preserved normal scrolling when users add criteria or otherwise expand the page.
- Converted Browse into compact index ledgers with panel-scoped search fields for people/entities, places/locations, and route pairs; the Routes panel appears only when the active dataset has meaningful source-target route data.
- Made Browse route-aware for point-only datasets so point/site uploads show entity and location indexes without self-route artifacts.
- Reworked Results into a compact ledger/table model with route-aware columns, point-dataset columns, Inspector-style pagination, 10/25/50 page-size controls, row-density tuning, and descender-safe text rendering.
- Reworked Refine / Inspect into a route-aware facet dashboard with compact default panels, fuller collapsed chip counts, Show all / Show less expansion, row-height expansion that moves lower panels down cleanly, and no route-only facets for point datasets.
- Tightened Capabilities spacing so its default review page fits the workspace better, and corrected the dark-background **Review note** text to use cream/light text.
- Changed Explore Inspector handoff so clicking **Inspect** from Explore opens the full Inspector as an overlay above the current Explore page instead of navigating away from the researcher’s active search context.
- Added gentle Explore entrance and tab-transition choreography: folio/header reveal, left-to-right step-button sequencing, slower content dissolve/rise, animated Refine panels, Results row “page-turn” filing, Browse index-row filing, and reduced-motion fallbacks.
- Restored Explore scrolling after animation-layer testing so expanded Refine panels, Results pages, Browse lists, and criteria-heavy Build views can scroll normally.

### Data mapping redesign, workbook controls, upload animation, menu, and Learn More polish milestone

- Updated the documented safe baseline to **`d04eaf6` — `Hide theme menu entry and animate learn more cards`**.
- Redesigned the column/workbook mapping modal into a more compact Peridot folio workflow: shorter header chrome, compact step rail, Preview/Sheets/Time/Places/Relations/Evidence/Review sequencing, cream working cards, clearer right-side guidance panels, and consistent gold divider ornaments.
- Refined Preview so uploaded tables show a compact file-preview strip and an 11-row horizontally scrollable preview table without the older large statistic cards.
- Reworked Time, Places, Relations, and Review mapping pages so users see role-oriented controls rather than large explanatory stacks, with workbook and single-sheet paths kept visually aligned.
- Rebuilt the workbook **Sheets** step as a two-column workbook-assembly page with primary record sheet, primary unique-ID column, joined-sheet setup, guidance copy, and a compact likely-primary-sheet note.
- Replaced stacked workbook sheet/column selectors on Time, Places, and Relations with combined sheet-column field selectors while preserving the internal `{ sheetName, columnName }` workbook mapping model.
- Kept workbook Evidence grouped by sheet, but simplified default field labels so the sheet name is no longer duplicated inside each evidence display label.
- Refined Review warnings so capability reassurance appears once, coordinate warnings are consolidated, and all warning cards share the same neutral warning styling.
- Added staged upload-mapping entrance animation for the mapping modal, including slow modal/header/step/body/footer reveal and left-to-right step sequencing.
- Simplified step-to-step upload navigation after testing carousel variants; the accepted behavior is an opacity-only step transition that avoids bright cream flashes, lateral jolts, scale changes, blur, or upward drift.
- Removed **Themes and Accessibility** from the visible hamburger menu while retaining the internal Theme workspace mode, component, and routing path for future restoration.
- Added matching entrance animation to the two **Learn More about Peridot** placeholder cards by reusing the existing Data workspace float-in classes.

### Inspector reference-entry layout, mounted overlay, Unknown-as-place, and record-table capability milestone

- Updated the documented safe baseline to **`74db963` — `Refine Inspector reference layout and record tables`**.
- Kept the Visualizations workspace mounted behind the full Inspector overlay so opening/closing the full Inspector no longer reloads or replays the underlying map/network/chart workspace.
- Suppressed Visualizations header/timeline hide-show buttons while the full Inspector overlay is open so those controls do not layer above the Inspector.
- Fixed Inspector related-person navigation from geographic/place contexts by preserving the people-graph fallback through selection resolution; related person and related place navigation now share the same full-workspace Inspector pathway and Back history.
- Reworked the full person/place Inspector from a dashboard-card model into a scholarly reference-entry layout with a lead summary, optional image/placeholder, prose description, compact summary facts, connected places, connected people, directed connections, selected fields, and connected records.
- Refined the compact side Inspector so it remains an at-a-glance summary while using the same Peridot dark-green/cream/gold reference visual language as the full Inspector.
- Added expandable connected people/place/connection lists so high-volume entities such as Firenze/Fiorenza and von Habsburg, Maria Magdalena do not silently truncate at an arbitrary count.
- Treated **Unknown** as a first-class place-like bucket, parallel to person/entity values such as **Illegible**, so unresolved or missing place values are preserved, counted, and navigable where the record metadata can support an Inspector view.
- Updated connected-record tables to support sorting, per-column filtering, 10/25/50 page-size controls, first/previous/numbered/next/end pagination, and date-first chronological defaults.
- Made connected-record table columns capability-aware: relational source-target datasets show source entity, target entity, source location, and target location columns, while point-only datasets show the simpler entity/location form.
- Shifted Inspector wording from correspondence-only language toward generic humanistic-data language: related records / connected records, person/entity, connected places, connected people, and directed connections.
- Updated Inspector filigree assets and divider styling so the full and compact Inspector can use thin unobtrusive gold ornaments without relying on heavy glow/diamond fallback effects.

### Workspace animation, chart-builder polish, force-network focus, and Inspector styling milestone

- Updated the documented safe baseline to **`bd9b807` — `Refine inspector workspace styling`**.
- Added staged entrance choreography for Home, Manage Your Data, Visualizations, Timeline controls, and Chart Visualizations.
- Added visualization-stage transitions that fade the outgoing view into a solid dark-green field and fade directly into the next visualization without a loading label or intentional hold.
- Added left-to-right timeline element sequencing after the timeline bar itself floats into place.
- Redesigned Chart Visualizations as a more cohesive builder surface: muted dark-green side panel, four clearer builder tabs now labeled **Chart type**, **X/Y variables**, **Visible categories**, and **Presentation**, high-contrast inactive/hover/active tab states, one-time guided reveal, and chart fade-in after the builder context appears.
- Applied a consistent Peridot gold treatment to chart-builder cream-card interactables, including buttons, dropdowns, steppers, text inputs, reset buttons, and category controls, while preserving side-panel scroll and dropdown layering.
- Centered the Force-Directed Network initial viewport on the densest network cluster / strongest nearby focal area rather than presenting the whole graph evenly.
- Updated the Inspector full workspace and compact side panel to share the chart-builder visual language: muted dark-green shell, cream information cards, gold primary commands, muted-green related-object navigation, and more restrained passive metadata treatment.
- Suppressed visualization header/timeline hide-show toggles when the full Inspector workspace is open, while preserving those controls in ordinary Visualizations mode.
- Recorded an open Inspector behavior issue for a fresh diagnostic pass: related-person navigation from some Inspector contexts opens the blank state; related-place navigation is working. The failed attempted fix touched `interactionHelpers.js` and `InspectorClusterView.jsx` and was rolled back with a clean tree.

### Home title-card, map export options, branding assets, and capability wording milestone

- Updated the documented safe baseline to **`68f99da` — `add some homepage assets`**.
- Renamed the local source-of-truth folder in documentation to `C:\Users\haley\OneDrive\Desktop\Peridot\`.
- Updated the repository URL in documentation to `https://github.com/haleyrp1803/peridot-humanistic-data`.
- Redesigned the Home workspace as an informative-minimalist fixed-ratio title-card composition.
- Home now centers the app identity around the gilded transparent Peridot logo, a single concise sentence, and two CTAs: **Use sample data** and **Upload your data**.
- Moved detailed onboarding expectations out of Home and into the future **Learn More about Peridot** direction.
- Added and documented the homepage layout contract: the logo is the largest object, the sentence is second-level text, button labels are smallest, and the filigree frames the content without overlapping it.
- Added the selected licensed Adobe Stock filigree to the Home workspace as decorative framing.
- Tracked the larger licensed Adobe Stock filigree set as a future design-reference asset.
- Added homepage mockup and annotated mockup references so future homepage changes preserve the intended proportional layout.
- Added the current homepage screenshot reference for documentation.
- Added gilded Peridot logo variants and palette/design reference assets to `assets/`.
- Preserved `assets/Peridot Logo Workspace.psd` as an ignored local design source rather than a committed runtime/documentation asset.
- Finalized map PNG export options: default output is map-only, with no Peridot branding or extra text.
- Added optional map export title placement above the map image and optional metadata placement below the map image.
- Improved map export annotation readability with larger Peridot typography and tighter whitespace.
- Clarified Data/Advanced Search/Visualizations capability wording: internal capability diagnostics were removed from user-facing review; point and route map readiness language was combined/clarified where appropriate; unavailable visualization language now says the visualization is **not available** for the dataset rather than **limited**.
- Confirmed point/site datasets such as Alaskan Airfields do not incorrectly advertise relational route/network readiness when no source-target relationships are mapped.

### Peridot logo and home-workspace branding milestone

- Added the user-designed Peridot logo assets to `assets/` as `Peridot Logo.png` and `Peridot Logo Transparent.png`.
- Integrated the transparent-background logo into the Home workspace hero while preserving an accessible hidden `h1` for the app name.
- Documented the logo asset locations in README, Maintainer Guide, and Workflow Charter so future branding passes keep the app and documentation synchronized.

### Theme, visualization chrome, map palette, and Analytics chart layout/theme milestone

- Routed Inspector and related evidence surfaces through semantic theme roles so color changes are controlled from the central theme system rather than scattered component constants.
- Preserved the Peridot ornamental folio language while tightening visualization chrome, including header tabs, edge handles, map utility buttons, collapse/expand affordances, and chart control surfaces.
- Reworked the Visualizations header and Timeline collapse/expand controls as ornamental, high-layer edge controls so the buttons remain in front of map/chart surfaces and communicate direction without relying on text-heavy labels.
- Added dropdown/portal layering safeguards for chart and workspace menus so expanded menus do not fall behind visualization layers.
- Added a light navy sea map treatment, dark map frame, muted green land treatment, active-land olive emphasis, and label-density/collision polish.
- Added a finite 30-color Analytics chart series library sourced from the approved green, gold, blue, and pink palettes, with greens/golds dominant and blues/pinks used as supporting contrast. This remains the default chart palette rather than a hard lock.
- Documented the color/theming audit trail in `planning_documents`, including color centralization, theme palette, built-in palette, classic itch palette, theme-control, map-assignment, upload-guide, dropdown-portal, and ornamental-toggle audits.
- Refined the Chart Visualizations control rail, dropdown hover treatment, series contrast, and chart workspace surface colors.
- Defaulted Analytics ordered date charts to **Year**, with **Full date** available as an explicit higher-granularity option.
- Hardened chart derivation logic for record counts, part-to-whole charts, grouped bars, stacked bars, multi-line charts, histograms, heatmaps, and year/full-date handling.
- Fixed grouped bar and multi-line count buckets so grouped yearly values use real counts rather than presence/absence.
- Added manual category/series selection across chart types, with compatible settings preserved as users switch between charts.
- Added persistent chart summary panels for ranked values, segment totals, line totals, trend summaries, bin ranges, matrix combinations, slices/shares, and sunburst parent totals.
- Added stronger major and minor axis ticks/gridlines for axis-based charts and kept chart PNG export using the rendered SVG panel/axis system.
- Rebuilt the Analytics builder as a tabbed control surface with **Chart**, **Fields**, **Categories**, and **Present** tabs.
- Resized the builder/chart composition so controls occupy roughly one-quarter of the workspace and the chart area occupies roughly three-quarters.
- Added custom presentation-title support and kept generated chart titles available as the default reference.
- Improved bar labels, metric choices, and chart-method labeling so chart cards communicate axis/measure/hierarchy semantics without relying only on hover.
- Reworked chart-card geometry around a shared renderer layout: left three-fourths for chart marks, right fourth for complete simplified legend/summary rows.
- Removed folded “x more” legend behavior so legends represent every displayed item, then simplified each row to label/value to avoid metadata clutter.
- Tightened chart-card padding and anchored title/subtitle placement near the top of the card while preserving chart/legend scale.
- Restored Bar Chart default orientation to **Vertical**, while keeping horizontal orientation available.
- Scoped chart-targeted palette imports so **Charts** changes update `analytics.series` without recoloring app chrome.
- Routed remaining bar, histogram, and heatmap marks through the active chart series palette so every chart type responds to explicit chart-palette imports.
- Current implemented Analytics/theme baseline: **`e50ebf6` — `Scope chart palette imports to chart series`**.

### Advanced Search / Explore consolidation milestone

- Routed **Explore Your Data** directly to Advanced Search from both the hamburger menu and the Visualizations header.
- Moved the former "what this data can do" capability summary into a dedicated **Capabilities** tab inside Advanced Search.
- Reworked Search into a tabbed research workflow: **Build Search**, **Browse**, **Results**, **Refine / Inspect**, and **Capabilities**.
- Added result cards with compact record summaries, match explanations, capability badges, and full Inspector handoff.
- Added result facets with counts so users can refine current results by people/entities, places, routes, years, capabilities, and evidence fields.
- Added global capability filters for Inspector/map/route/network/timeline/evidence readiness and missing date/coordinate conditions.
- Added dataset-wide Browse indexes for People / Entities, Places, Routes, and Evidence Fields; Browse items fill draft search criteria and preserve the explicit Apply Filters workflow.
- Added structured criteria rows with predictive suggestions and an increased five-row cap.
- Added Boolean structured-search logic with user-facing connectors: first criterion starts the group, later criteria use **AND**, **OR**, or **EXCLUDING**.
- Preserved the core draft/apply model: typing, suggestions, Browse selections, facet selections, and structured criteria edits change draft state only until **Apply Filters** is pressed.
- Current implemented Advanced Search baseline: **`d52392a` — `Add capabilities tab to advanced search`**.

### Structural cleanup, commenting, and scope-contract milestone

- Added developer-orientation comments across the source tree so a new human developer can understand major sections, cross-file responsibilities, fragile compatibility paths, and non-obvious state coupling.
- Added `planning_documents/PERIDOT_CODE_STRUCTURE_AUDIT.md` as the standing structural audit and cleanup roadmap.
- Extracted embedded sample data from `App.jsx` into `src/peridotSampleData.js`.
- Reduced `src/LeftControlPanel.jsx` to the compact Inspector side-panel shell, removing obsolete rail/workflow content while preserving visualization-click Inspector behavior.
- Extracted column-mapping modal static UI configuration into `src/peridotColumnMappingUiConfig.js`.
- Extracted repeated column-mapping field controls into `src/PeridotMappingFieldControls.jsx`.
- Extracted evidence/analysis Include/Ignore controls into `src/PeridotEvidenceFieldControls.jsx`.
- Documented the Analytics chart-extension contract across config, derivation, rendering, panel, and visualization-header files.
- Removed dormant MapLibre preview files and dependency from active `main`.
- Documented the loaded/filter/timeline/playback/export scope pipeline and clamped chart-local date ranges so chart animation does not get stuck on stale time selections.
- Current implemented structural-cleanup baseline: **`fcd2e1f` — `Document timeline scope and clamp chart date range`**.

### Visualization workspace compression, menu simplification, timeline, and export consolidation milestone

- Redesigned Chart Visualizations from a compact chart-picker panel into a large chart workspace with controls on the left and a full-size chart canvas on the right.
- Removed the redundant chart-workspace header and scaled chart rendering so charts fit the available workspace without internal scrolling.
- Added a collapsible Visualizations header and a collapsible bottom Timeline bar, both starting expanded.
- Implemented the Timeline as a compact bottom scrubber inside Visualizations with dual range handles, playback controls, reset/all-dates controls, and playback position controls.
- Changed map legend and controls to start minimized as bottom-corner buttons that can be opened and minimized in place.
- Simplified the hamburger menu to **Manage Your Data**, **Visualize Your Data**, **Explore Your Data**, **Learn More about Peridot**, and, at that stage, **Themes and Accessibility** before the later user-facing menu hide.
- Added `src/PeridotExploreWorkspace.jsx` for combined capability summary, Search access, and Inspector-adjacent evidence review.
- Added `src/PeridotLearnMoreWorkspace.jsx` as a placeholder for future project information, credits, tutorials, and help content.
- Reframed Theme as **Themes and Accessibility**.
- Moved map/network export actions into the Visualizations header Export menu.
- Moved chart PNG export out of the chart controls rail and into the same Visualizations header Export menu.
- Removed the obsolete standalone Export workspace route and deleted `src/PeridotExportWorkspace.jsx` from the active source tree.
- Current implemented visualization-workspace/export baseline: **`fcd2e1f` — `Document timeline scope and clamp chart date range`**.

### Visualization capability and flexible Analytics milestone

- Added capability-aware Visualizations workspace menus for Mapping Visualizations, Network Visualizations, Chart Visualizations, and Explore Your Data.
- Added readable availability labels, forgiving hover behavior, and unavailable-state explanations when a dataset cannot support a selected map, network, or chart view.
- Changed Chart Visualizations so the dropdown lists chart types directly rather than a broad Analytics entry.
- Generalized Analytics chart controls around user-selected x-axis/category fields, y-axis/metric fields, aggregation, grouping/series fields, heatmap rows/columns, histogram distributions, and selected wide numeric series.
- Made **Record count** an explicit metric for aggregate chart types, including histogram and sunburst.
- Cleaned chart language so generic record/metric charts no longer imply that all values are letters.
- Current implemented flexible-Analytics baseline: **`ab7affa` — `Clean up flexible Analytics chart controls`**.

### Generic chart/evidence record and mapping-field inclusion milestone

- Generalized user-facing app language beyond correspondence-only wording while preserving compatibility terms and legacy internal names where still required.
- Added generic chart/evidence row admission so chart-first and evidence-first datasets can enter the active dataset without map or network roles.
- Kept map and network availability capability-based: generic chart records can be chart-ready and export-ready while remaining unmappable and non-network-ready.
- Replaced the Evidence and analysis include/ignore dropdown control with explicit **Include** and **Ignore** checkboxes per field, defaulting to Include.
- Current implemented generic-record and evidence-field UI baseline: **`08b628b` — `Use include and ignore checkboxes for evidence fields`**.

### Data capability and role-based mapping milestone

- Added `planning_documents/PERIDOT_DATA_CAPABILITY_MODEL_PLAN.md` to define Peridot's broader humanistic-data capability model.
- Added `src/peridotDataCapabilityAudit.js` as a pure helper for field-role inference and dataset capability reporting.
- Moved the data capability audit to the mapping-review decision point instead of leaving it as a post-cancel Data workspace status card.
- Reorganized the mapping modal away from **Map Peridot variables** and **Choose Inspector fields** toward role-based stages: **Identify records**, **Time**, **Places**, **Relationships**, **Evidence and analysis**, and **Review capabilities**.
- Added explicit temporal mapping roles for single date, date start, date end, and display date.
- Added point-location mapping roles for datasets with one location per record.
- Added combined coordinate-pair mapping roles for point records and source/target route records, using latitude-first pairs.
- Preserved existing correspondence route/network behavior while allowing non-network point/site datasets to import and render in Place Map.
- Confirmed that point/site datasets without source-target relationships correctly do not populate People Network or Force-Directed views.
- Current implemented data-capability baseline: **`e7c3b57` — `Add point-location role mapping`**.

### Home/workspace visual-system milestone

- Refined the Home workspace layout and menu access.
- Removed Home navigation from active workspaces.
- Applied the Home-style visual system to full workspaces.
- Standardized most workspace button hover/highlight states around the existing gold-brown accent.

### Dual-mode Inspector workspace milestone

- Added `planning_documents/PERIDOT_INSPECTOR_WORKSPACE_CONTRACT.md` to define the compact/full Inspector model.
- Prepared `InspectorPanel.jsx` as a reusable Inspector content boundary.
- Added Inspector presentation modes for `closed`, `compact`, `workspace`, and `empty-workspace`.
- Changed visualization clicks so nodes, edges, and clusters open the compact side-panel Inspector.
- Changed hamburger **Inspector** so it opens the full Inspector workspace rather than the compact side panel.
- Added compact **Expand Inspector** behavior and `[x]`/Escape close behavior for compact and full modes.
- Kept the most recently used Visualizations state mounted underneath the full Inspector workspace.
- Refined the dual-mode Inspector visual treatment with a Peridot/moss/cream palette.
- Reduced compact Inspector content so it functions as an at-a-glance summary rather than a full dossier.
- Moved linked-letter detail into shared Inspector state/history.
- Made linked-letter source/target people and places clickable.
- Made compact summary tiles open the full Inspector workspace for the same selected entity.
- Made directed route rows open route/edge Inspector dossiers with linked letters.
- Current implemented Inspector baseline: **`b24e19a` — `Link Inspector directed route rows`**.

### Interface redesign and workspace-routing milestone

- Added `PERIDOT_INTERFACE_REDESIGN_PLAN.md` to define the shift from a map-first side-panel app toward a multimodal correspondence data exploration workspace.
- Added internal workspace state and extracted workspace configuration into `src/peridotWorkspaceConfig.js`.
- Added Home / welcome startup behavior and routed users into Data or Visualizations from the landing page.
- Replaced the visible persistent icon rail with a hamburger-triggered labeled menu.
- Promoted Theme to a full workspace.
- Created and extracted full workspace components for Home, Data, Theme, Visualizations, Export, and Search & Filter.
- Added `src/PeridotHamburgerMenu.jsx`, `src/PeridotHomeWorkspace.jsx`, `src/PeridotDataWorkspace.jsx`, `src/PeridotThemeWorkspace.jsx`, `src/PeridotVisualizationsWorkspace.jsx`, `src/PeridotExportWorkspace.jsx`, `src/PeridotSearchWorkspace.jsx`, and `src/peridotWorkspaceConfig.js`.
- Moved Analytics into the Visualizations workspace while preserving compact preview sizing and expanded chart behavior.
- Promoted Export to a full workspace with a live visualization preview preserved for SVG/PNG export.
- Promoted Search & Filter to a full workspace while preserving existing keyword/person/place/route/date/weight controls and predictive suggestions.
- Updated `PERIDOT_ROUTING_CONTRACT_AUDIT.md` after Search and Export were promoted.
- Deferred Timeline promotion; the preferred future design is now a bottom timeline/scrubber integrated with Visualizations.
- Deferred Inspector promotion pending a careful full evidence-dossier design contract.

### Workbook / Excel import and Inspector profile milestone

- Added workbook-aware staging and parsing for CSV, TSV, XLSX, and XLS files.
- Added workbook mapping helpers that model primary record sheets, sheet/column references, core Peridot field mappings, and unique-ID joins.
- Added a workbook mapping workspace for multi-sheet Excel files.
- Let users manually add multiple joined sheets and choose arbitrary unique-ID columns on the primary and joined sheets.
- Assembled multi-sheet workbook rows into Peridot-shaped records using configured unique-ID joins.
- Let users choose custom Inspector/Analytics fields from primary and joined workbook sheets.
- Displayed user-selected custom fields in linked letter cards.
- Reworked person and place Inspector views into profile summaries with related people, related places, directed routes, date spans, linked-letter counts, and selected uploaded fields.
- Added dedicated linked-letter detail pages inside the Inspector rather than expanding long records inline.
- Fixed place-profile fallback behavior so places clicked from profile lists can resolve from linked-record metadata.
- Removed redundant top-level Inspector fields once the richer profile sections covered the same information.

### Arbitrary column mapping and workbook-parsing milestone

- Added `src/peridotColumnMapping.js` to define column-mapping helpers for mapping user-uploaded tables into Peridot’s internal field model.
- Added `src/PeridotColumnMappingModal.jsx` as the large mapping workspace for arbitrary CSV/TSV imports.
- Staged arbitrary CSV and TSV uploads for mapping rather than assuming incoming files already match the Peridot template.
- Imported mapped arbitrary CSV/TSV data into the active Peridot data pipeline.
- Clarified cancel/import actions so the mapping workflow is less ambiguous.
- Added `src/peridotWorkbookParsing.js` as the workbook parsing helper for the planned Excel path.
- Removed the ordinary legacy three-file upload workflow after the one-file/mapped-import direction became the active public data-ingestion model.

### Standardized single-CSV Data Inputs milestone

- Added `src/peridotCsvSchema.js` to define the public template columns, field groupings, minimum record rule, capability labels, and upload tips.
- Added `src/peridotCsvNormalizer.js` to convert the public one-file template into existing internal geography, letter metadata, person metadata, and place row shapes.
- Added `src/peridotCsvValidation.js` to build validation summaries and row-capability reports.
- Simplified the ordinary Data Inputs panel to foreground **Download CSV template**, **Upload completed CSV**, latest upload summary, and concise data tips.
- Added an upload validation popup and kept the same information accessible after close through a persistent side-panel summary.
- Established the database-first upload policy: accepted rows may be incomplete; coordinates and parseable dates are capability-enabling fields rather than upload-admission requirements; Peridot does not clean, standardize, merge, or enforce controlled vocabularies for uploaded user data.

### Search & Filter implementation and layout milestone

- Implemented the dedicated **Search & Filter** rail tab and promoted it from planning contract to active global-filtering UI.
- Search & Filter owns draft/apply controls for keyword search, person filter, place filter, **Route Filter (Place)**, **Route Filter (People)**, minimum correspondence weight, and date range.
- Predictive suggestion menus appear after at least two typed characters, are capped visually to about five visible suggestions, allow scrolling for more matches, and fill draft fields only.
- **Apply Filters** commits all active filter controls together.
- **Clear Filters** clears keyword/person/place/route filters, restores minimum weight to `1`, restores the full available date range, and resets playback.
- Pre-update status feedback appears before expensive full-dataset recomputation begins.
- Later visual refinements converted Search & Filter from stacked explanatory cards into a compact advanced-search form.

### Analytics feature and visual-polish milestone

- Added the Analytics side-panel tab with chart previews, chart controls, chart descriptions, and PNG export.
- Added multiple chart types, expanded chart controls, dynamic variable detection, route-place/route-person variables, and an expanded chart overlay.
- Improved Analytics chart hover-tooltip contrast.
- Refined the expanded Analytics view: dark green translucent backdrop, cool off-white text/borders, preserved blurred-map effect, and white/cream chart card.

### Side-panel and cluster milestones

- Consolidated the app around a shared left-side panel shell with a persistent rail.
- Added dedicated rail tabs for Data Inputs, Search & Filter, Export, Timeline, Analytics, Controls, and Inspector.
- Made the Inspector content-only inside the shared panel shell.
- Made clusters actionable in the inspector, grouped cluster members by place, and made cluster sizing reflect represented letter volume.

## Deferred / rolled-back work

### MapLibre migrated-overlay work paused / active preview removed

The later MapLibre migrated-overlay branch is paused and should be retained as an archived experiment, not treated as active `main` code. The old dormant MapLibre preview files and dependency have now been removed from active `main` in `55a368c`.

If MapLibre is revisited later, start from a fresh branch/source-of-truth audit and reintroduce any needed dependencies intentionally. Do not assume the experimental branch can be merged wholesale.

### Force-Directed fallback issue on MapLibre experiment

During the later MapLibre experiment, Force-Directed was intended to bypass MapLibre and use the legacy D3/SVG force-directed view. That routing was partly established, but the force view still blanked after briefly rendering. Several speculative sizing fixes were rolled back, and the branch was set aside. Future work should diagnose the legacy force-render path directly before attempting new fixes.

### Shared-panel prop rename attempt, after `4a17d1c`

A cleanup attempt was made to rename the old `showLeftSidebar` / `showRightSidebar` compatibility prop path to newer shared-panel naming. This was rolled back because it broke Inspector auto-open behavior when clicking nodes, edges, or clusters.

Future work should treat this path as fragile. If the old names are renamed later, the pass must explicitly test node click, edge click, cluster click, contained cluster-member click, and Back behavior.

### Panel responsive sizing attempt, after `b62c74b`

A responsive panel-sizing experiment attempted to make the shared side panel absolutely positioned at all viewport sizes. It was rolled back because it disrupted the full-size landscape layout and forced scrolling before the map. Future responsive-panel work should be designed as a narrow-window override rather than a universal positioning replacement.
