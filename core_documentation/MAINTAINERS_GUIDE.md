# Maintainer's Guide

## Executive Summary

This guide is Peridot’s authoritative current architecture and maintenance reference. Use it to identify ownership boundaries, current data and interaction contracts, fragile systems, stylesheet responsibilities, regression expectations, and the active technical backlog before changing source code.

It complements the Project Workflow Charter, which governs process, and the Changelog, which preserves historical chronology. This guide does not reproduce full commit history; it records what the current architecture requires a maintainer to understand and preserve.

## Document Role and Boundaries

This document owns current architecture, source/module ownership, state and data contracts, fragile-zone descriptions, regression matrices, compatibility paths, and the active technical backlog. It does not own full commit chronology, broad public onboarding, or the mandatory process rules for changing source; those belong respectively to the Changelog, README, and Project Workflow Charter.

Current synchronized checkpoint:

## 1. Current Architecture Snapshot

Peridot is a Vite/React/Tailwind research application that has moved from a map-first side-panel model to a workspace-first, multimodal exploration environment. `src/App.jsx` remains the top-level orchestration boundary, while dedicated workspaces and pure/helper modules now own much of the UI, import, visualization, theme, and interaction behavior.

The active public workflow is Home → Manage Your Data → Visualize Your Data → Explore Your Data → Learn More. Themes and Accessibility remains route-compatible but intentionally hidden from the public hamburger menu. Timeline and Export are Visualizations-integrated surfaces; Inspector is a compact/full shared-state evidence system.

A first-time tutorial now overlays this workspace model. Its accepted flow begins in Visualizations and guides the researcher through Visualizations, Timeline, Inspector, Explore, Browse / Apply, Working Set, and Export. The former standalone tutorial Start page has been removed. The tutorial retains draggable panels, minimize/restore docking, step progression and recovery, keyboard-accessible controls, target anchoring/highlighting, and a Home-page entry point.

### Current source context

- Local source of truth: `C:\Users\haley\OneDrive\Desktop\Peridot\`
- Active continuation branch: `main`
- Repository: `https://github.com/haleyrp1803/peridot-humanistic-data`
- Active D3/SVG path: MapLibre experimental work is archived and not part of active `main`.

### Supporting planning documents

The following tracked planning documents remain relevant maintenance references:

- `planning_documents/PERIDOT_INTERFACE_REDESIGN_PLAN.md` — original workspace-first redesign rationale and public-navigation direction.
- `planning_documents/PERIDOT_ROUTING_CONTRACT_AUDIT.md` — routing and compatibility-boundary audit.
- `planning_documents/PERIDOT_INSPECTOR_WORKSPACE_CONTRACT.md` — compact/full Inspector model and shared-state contract.
- `planning_documents/PERIDOT_CODE_STRUCTURE_AUDIT.md` — structural cleanup roadmap and bounded future decomposition reference.

### Application-boundary inventory

| System | Primary owner | Core responsibility | Sensitive coupling | Minimum regression check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Top-level orchestration | `App.jsx` | state, derived data, routing, Inspector history, export wiring | filters, timeline, compact/full Inspector bridge | open each workspace; upload/use sample; click node/edge/cluster |
| Workspace navigation | `peridotWorkspaceConfig.js`, `PeridotHamburgerMenu.jsx` | public routing and hidden Theme path | active workspace state, Inspector presentation | hamburger routes; Home CTAs; return paths |
| First-time tutorial | tutorial state, panel, dock, anchor/highlight, and Home-entry boundaries | seven-stage guided workflow, progression, recovery, draggable/minimized presentation | workspace routing, Inspector close behavior, target observation, keyboard focus | launch from Home; complete all stages; drag; minimize/restore; Back/Continue; close Inspector when instructed |
| Data import | Data workspace + mapping/import helpers | parse, map, validate, normalize, capability audit | upload reset and downstream data scope | template, CSV, TSV, XLSX, XLS, mapped import |
| Visualizations | `PeridotVisualizationsWorkspace.jsx` | modes, header, stage, Timeline placement, Export menu | stage sizing, Inspector overlay, portal layers | map/network/chart switch; header/timeline controls |

| Inspector | Inspector modules + `App.jsx` | compact/full evidence dossier and history | selection resolution, mounted overlay | node/edge/cluster; Expand; Back; close |
| Analytics | Analytics modules | controls, derivation, SVG rendering and chart export | scope/date handling, palette roles | chart switch, series selection, export |
| Theme/CSS | theme modules + stylesheets | semantic colors and component presentation | import order, dropdown/z-index, reduced motion | theme role/palette change; each workspace |
| Export | `exportHelpers.js` + Visualizations header | image/tabular export | visible/selected/charted scope | SVG/PNG/CSV output |

## 2. Application Boundaries and Route Model

Peridot uses a workspace-first route model. The active public path is **Home → Manage Your Data → Visualize Your Data → Explore Your Data → Learn More**. The hamburger menu is the primary visible navigation surface. **Themes and Accessibility** remains implemented and route-compatible, but is intentionally hidden from the public menu.

### Workspace boundaries

| Surface | User-facing role | Primary boundary | Important maintenance condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Home | concise start surface | `PeridotHomeWorkspace.jsx` | preserve fixed-ratio, non-scrolling title-card composition |
| Manage Your Data | import, mapping, validation | `PeridotDataWorkspace.jsx`, mapping/import helpers | preserve permissive database-first ingestion and explicit user mapping |
| Visualize Your Data | map, network, charts, Timeline, Export | `PeridotVisualizationsWorkspace.jsx` | preserve stage sizing, mounted Inspector behavior, and header/timeline layering |
| Explore Your Data | Advanced Search and research scope | `PeridotSearchWorkspace.jsx` | preserve draft/apply semantics and return-to-state Inspector handoff |
| Learn More | project context and help | `PeridotLearnMoreWorkspace.jsx` | preserve editorial reading flow and divider choreography |
| Themes and Accessibility | internal appearance/settings workspace | `PeridotThemeWorkspace.jsx` | retain route/component even while menu entry is hidden |
| Inspector | compact selection summary and full dossier | Inspector modules + `App.jsx` | compact/full modes share selection and Back history |

### First-time tutorial contract

The tutorial is a guided overlay system rather than a separate workspace. Its current accepted contract is:

- Begin directly with Visualizations; do not restore the removed standalone Start page.
- Preserve the seven-stage sequence: Visualizations → Timeline → Inspector → Explore → Browse / Apply → Working Set → Export.
- Preserve draggable tutorial panels, minimize/restore docking, Back/Continue progression, recovery logic, and keyboard accessibility.
- Keep the current dialogue composition: large centered title, one sentence per frame, footer progress, and the Adobe Stock Filigree 3 divider treatment.
- Keep target highlighting and the stabilized observer behavior represented by the `619bab0` baseline.
- Explicitly require the user to close the Inspector before the tutorial advances from Inspector guidance.
- Treat stronger attention animation as deferred experimentation, not as current functionality.

Minimum regression checks: launch from Home; progress forward and backward through every stage; drag the panel; minimize and restore it; verify keyboard progression/focus; verify each target anchor; open and close Inspector at the instructed step; recover cleanly from a temporarily unavailable target.

### Current route and visualization model

- Visualizations exposes capability-aware Place Map, People Network, Force-Directed Network, and Chart Visualizations views.
- Timeline is a year-based bottom scrubber within Visualizations; Export is a shared Visualizations header menu rather than a separate workspace.
- Advanced Search is the primary Explore surface and owns global applied filtering.
- Legacy rail and panel paths exist only as compatibility bridges where they preserve visualization-click Inspector behavior.
- MapLibre work is archived; active `main` uses the D3/SVG path.

Detailed subsystem contracts appear in Sections 4–8. The module index in Section 9 identifies the concrete source owners.

## 3. Data Lifecycle and Scope Vocabulary

Use these terms consistently:

| Scope term | Definition | Created by | Consumed by | Known audit caveat |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| loaded data | all records currently loaded in the app | sample-data or import path | Search, visualization derivation, Analytics, export | may contain incomplete but accepted records |
| mapped/normalized data | accepted rows after explicit mapping and internal transformation | CSV/workbook mapping and normalizers | graph, capability, search, Inspector paths | mapping policy must remain user-confirmed |
| applied/filtered data | records included after Advanced Search criteria are committed | Search Apply Filters | visualizations, Inspector, Analytics, exports | formal coverage audit remains pending |
| timeline-visible data | records inside current timeline range/playback state | Timeline controls | active stage and related consumers | Timeline × Analytics audit remains pending |
| selected data | node, edge, cluster, entity, place, route, or record under inspection | interaction/Inspector state | compact/full Inspector | must preserve Back history |
| charted data | records or derived values supplied to a chart | Analytics derivation helpers | chart renderer and chart export | may be further constrained by chart-local settings |
| exported data | output explicitly described by an export action | export helpers/header actions | image/CSV file | labels must identify relevant scope |

The authoritative Advanced Search contract appears in [Section 5](#5-advanced-search--explore-contract). The scope vocabulary above must be used precisely until the dedicated coverage and Timeline × Analytics audits are complete.

## 4. Visualizations, Timeline, Inspector, and Export Contracts

### Inspector

The Inspector is a dual-mode evidence system. Visualization clicks open compact side-panel summaries; **Expand**, linked-data navigation, and full Inspector routes open the dossier workspace. Compact and full modes must share one selected target and multi-step Back history.

- `App.jsx` owns Inspector presentation mode, selection resolution, history, and linked person/place/record/route navigation.
- `InspectorPanel.jsx` owns shared Inspector content chrome; `InspectorBodyRouter.jsx` resolves view type.
- `InspectorNodeView.jsx`, `InspectorEdgeView.jsx`, and `InspectorClusterView.jsx` own the principal dossier views.
- The full Inspector overlays Visualizations without remounting the underlying stage. Closing it should restore the mounted visualization state.
- Connected-record tables retain date-first sorting, per-column filtering, 10/25/50 page sizes, pagination, and capability-aware relational versus point-only columns.
- **Unknown** remains a first-class place-like bucket for unresolved/missing locations.

Minimum regression checks: node, edge, and cluster click; compact close; Expand; related person/place; route/record navigation; Back; Explore-to-Inspector return; and full Inspector open/close without stage reanimation.

### Visualizations and Timeline

Visualizations owns capability-aware map, network, force-directed, and chart entry points; header collapse behavior; the bottom timeline scrubber; and the shared Export menu. Timeline is year-based and must remain a Visualizations-integrated control rather than a separate workspace.

### Export

Export is a header action rather than a top-level workspace. Map/network exports include SVG, PNG, nodes CSV, and edges/routes CSV; Chart Visualizations provides PNG export through the same header menu. Map PNG default output is map-only, without mandatory Peridot branding, with optional title and metadata annotations.

## 5. Advanced Search / Explore Contract

Advanced Search is the primary Explore Your Data surface and the owner of global **applied/filtered data**. It uses the explicit draft/apply model: typing, suggestions, Browse selections, facets, and structured criteria change draft state until **Apply Filters** commits the scope.

### Responsibilities

- Build Search supports keyword, person/entity, place, route-place, route-people, date, minimum-weight, capability, and structured criteria inputs.
- Browse exposes route-aware dataset indexes for people/entities, places/locations, and routes when relationship data exists.
- Results provides compact route-aware ledgers, pagination, and Inspector handoff.
- Refine / Inspect exposes applied-result facets; expansions fill draft controls for later Apply rather than silently changing scope.
- Capabilities presents the active dataset’s supported research surfaces.
- Inspect opens the full Inspector above the current Explore state, so closing it returns the researcher to the same search context.

### Scope and regression contract

Search is a fragile active-data boundary. After changes, verify draft suggestions, Apply, Clear, criteria connectors, Browse/facet behavior, Results pagination, Inspector return-to-state behavior, and interaction with Timeline, Analytics, and Export.

The dedicated Search coverage/scope audit remains pending. Do not state that every consumer applies loaded, filtered, timeline-visible, and chart-local scope identically until that audit is complete.


### Preserved detailed Search regression expectations

The following implementation-level expectations were relocated from the Project Workflow Charter so the Charter can remain process-focused. They remain current maintenance requirements.

<details>
<summary><strong>Open detailed Advanced Search preservation notes</strong></summary>

Advanced Search is the intended consolidation point for global filters and the primary Explore Your Data surface.

Committed Advanced Search controls include:

- keyword search
- person filter
- place filter
- **Route Filter (Place)**
- **Route Filter (People)**
- minimum correspondence weight
- date range
- predictive suggestions for person, place, route-place, route-people, start-year, end-year, and structured-criteria value fields
- structured criteria with AND / OR / EXCLUDING connectors
- dataset-wide Browse indexes for people/entities, places, routes, and evidence fields
- result cards with Inspector handoff
- result facets based on the current applied result set
- Capabilities tab containing what-this-data-can-do summaries
- **Apply Filters**
- **Clear Filters**
- pre-update status feedback

Future Advanced Search controls may include:

- language/relationship filters
- mappability filters
- safe categorical metadata filters
- inspector actions such as “filter to this person/place/route”

Filter controls should not trigger expensive graph/data recomputation on every keystroke or draft edit. Use draft values with an explicit **Apply Filters** action when the filter can affect the active dataset. Use **Clear Filters** to reset the global filter state. For expensive full-dataset updates, show visible feedback before committing state changes so users understand that the app is updating.

When changing Advanced Search, explicitly test:

- typing in a text field does not freeze the app
- filters apply only when intended
- current applied filter scope is clear to the user and remains visible near the top of the workspace
- Timeline playback remains functional
- Analytics receives the intended filtered scope
- Export scope remains clear

---

Detailed subsystem regression checks belong in the Maintainer’s Guide. Preserve the distinction between active paths, compatibility paths, and archived experiments.

## 6. Analytics Contract

Analytics is conceptually part of Visualizations. It supports Bar, Grouped Bar, Stacked Bar, Line, Multi-Line, Histogram, Pie, Sunburst, and Heatmap views; tabbed controls; manual category/series selection; persistent summaries/legends; a default finite 30-color series library; and chart PNG export.

Core ownership:
- `AnalyticsPanel.jsx` owns the configuration UI and registers export upward.
- `analyticsConfig.js` owns chart metadata, defaults, and curated variable definitions.
- `analyticsDerivationHelpers.js` owns variable detection, bucketing, filtering, aggregation, and chart-ready data.
- `analyticsChartComponents.jsx` owns SVG rendering, card/legend geometry, visible summaries, ticks/gridlines, theme-series marks, and exportable SVG surface.

The current accepted chart model uses a quarter-width control rail and three-quarter chart/legend card. Bar charts default to vertical orientation. Use semantic chart series roles rather than local hardcoded colors. Preserve the deferred Timeline playback × Analytics scope audit rather than asserting universal scope consistency.

## 7. Data Import and Workbook Contract

Peridot supports template CSV, explicit arbitrary CSV/TSV mapping, and workbook-aware XLSX/XLS import. The data model is database-first: accepted records may remain useful even when they are not map-, network-, or timeline-ready.

### Import contract

- `PeridotDataWorkspace.jsx` owns user entry, template download, upload launch, upload summary, and navigation into Visualizations.
- `PeridotColumnMappingModal.jsx` owns role-based mapping stages: Preview, Sheets where applicable, Time, Places, Relations, Evidence, and Review.
- Mapping is explicit and user-confirmed. Peridot does not silently standardize values or infer irreversible relationships.
- Workbooks use a selected primary record sheet and user-configured unique-ID joins; never use row-order joining as the primary assembly strategy.
- Combined sheet-column controls preserve the internal workbook reference model while keeping the mapping interface compact.
- Evidence/analysis fields use explicit Include and Ignore controls; selected fields remain available to supported Inspector and Analytics paths.
- Capability reporting distinguishes Inspector, Search, point-map, route-map, network, timeline, chart, and export readiness without rejecting otherwise useful incomplete records.

### Minimum regression checks

Test template download; CSV and TSV mapping; XLSX and XLS staging; primary-sheet selection; multiple joins; joined-field mapping; post-upload validation; retained accepted incomplete rows; Search reset/coherence; Timeline and Analytics scope after upload; Inspector navigation; and relevant exports.


### Preserved detailed import regression expectations

The following implementation-level expectations were relocated from the Project Workflow Charter so the Charter can remain process-focused. They remain current maintenance requirements.

<details>
<summary><strong>Open detailed data-import preservation notes</strong></summary>

Data Inputs is now the public owner of the standardized single-CSV upload workflow and the arbitrary table column-mapping workflow.

Committed Data Inputs behavior includes:

- downloadable Peridot CSV template;
- one unified CSV / TSV / XLSX / XLS table-workbook upload control;
- arbitrary CSV/TSV/Excel upload staging and role-based column mapping;
- mapped arbitrary-table import into Peridot data;
- post-upload validation popup;
- persistent latest-upload summary in the Data Inputs panel after the popup closes;
- capability reporting for Inspector, Search, point-map readiness, route-map readiness, network readiness, timeline readiness, Analytics/chart readiness, and Export;
- public legacy Geography / Raw Data / Person Metadata upload controls superseded by the one-file and mapped-import workflows;
- workbook parsing, mapping, unique-ID joins, and import assembly for XLSX/XLS workbooks;
- selected workbook custom fields visible in linked-record and entity-profile Inspector views;
- generic chart/evidence records admitted into the active dataset where they have usable content;
- evidence/analysis include/ignore checkboxes that default to Include.

Future Data Inputs changes should explicitly test:

- template download works;
- uploading a valid template CSV updates the app data;
- uploading a workbook stages sheets without freezing on reasonably sized files;
- workbook mapping can configure primary sheet, unique-ID joins, core field mapping, and selected Inspector fields;
- upload summary popup appears;
- closing the popup does not erase the persistent side-panel summary;
- rows lacking coordinates are not silently discarded if otherwise accepted;
- rows lacking parseable dates are not silently discarded if otherwise accepted;
- Inspector still opens after upload;
- Search & Filter resets or remains coherent after upload;
- Timeline playback does not use stale date scope after upload;
- Analytics receives the intended uploaded/filtered rows;
- Export still labels and exports the intended data scope.

Do not reintroduce the legacy three-file upload workflow unless there is a specific recovery or compatibility reason; the active public direction is one-file template upload plus mapped arbitrary-table import.

</details>

## 8. Theme and Stylesheet Architecture

### Semantic theme ownership

`peridotTheme.js` is the semantic theme control surface. New color work should extend theme roles rather than scatter component constants. `peridotThemeRoleMetadata.js` supplies human-facing role descriptions; `peridotColorPalette.js` remains a legacy compatibility adapter. Chart-targeted palette imports may override `analytics.series` without recoloring unrelated chrome.

### Stylesheet cascade contract

The active stylesheet architecture is component-oriented. `index.css` owns only shared/global rules: Tailwind setup, document defaults, shared cards/forms/buttons/ornaments, shared theme/design contracts, Visualizations-stage transitions, timeline choreography, and reduced-motion behavior.

`main.jsx` owns this functional cascade order:

```jsx
import './index.css';
import './InspectorPanel.css';
import './AnalyticsPanel.css';
import './PeridotSearchWorkspace.css';
import './PeridotColumnMappingModal.css';
import './PeridotLearnMoreWorkspace.css';
import './PeridotFeedbackForm.css';
```

| Stylesheet | Ownership boundary | Sensitive behavior | Verify after change |
|---|---|---|---|
| `index.css` | shared global layer | shared selectors and cross-workspace defaults | Home, Data, Visualizations, Explore, Learn More |
| `InspectorPanel.css` | compact/full/Explore Inspector | overlay and dossier presentation | compact click, Expand, Back, Explore handoff |
| `AnalyticsPanel.css` | chart builder and renderer chrome | controls, dropdown layering, reduced motion | chart switch, menus, export |
| `PeridotSearchWorkspace.css` | Explore folio/search | scroll containment and folio corners | expanded Build/Refine/Browse/Results scrolling |
| `PeridotColumnMappingModal.css` | role-mapping modal | modal layering and step transitions | table/workbook mapping flow |
| `PeridotLearnMoreWorkspace.css` | Learn More reading surface | portrait/text flow, dividers, expansion | biography, disclosure, Tutorials |
| `PeridotFeedbackForm.css` | feedback modal | modal layering and form layout | hamburger-adjacent form, backdrop/Escape, Visualizations controls |

CSS extraction, dead-rule removal, behavior repairs, and visual redesign are distinct bounded passes. The earlier component-style extraction sequence is historical context in the Changelog; the `7df46a8` import restoration is a correction to preserve this functional cascade, not a new architectural direction.

### Brand Assets and Home Workspace Constraints

The user-designed Peridot logo and related design assets live in `assets/`:

- `assets/Peridot Logo.png` — original solid-background logo for documentation/reference use.
- `assets/Peridot Logo Transparent.png` — original transparent-background logo.
- `assets/Peridot Logo Gilded.png` — revised gilded logo for documentation/reference use.
- `assets/Peridot Logo Gilded Transparent.png` — revised transparent logo used by the current Home workspace.
- `assets/Adobe Stock Filigree 1.png` — selected licensed filigree used as Home workspace framing.
- `assets/Adobe Stock Filigree Divider Set.png`
- `assets/Adobe Stock Filigree Full Set.png` — licensed Adobe Stock filigree set retained as a future design-reference asset.
- `assets/Homepage Current 2026-06-16.png` — current homepage screenshot for documentation.
- `assets/Homepage Layout Mockup.png` and `assets/Homepage Layout Mockup Annotated.png` — user-authored layout references for the homepage redesign.
- `assets/Chart Colors Base.jpeg`, `assets/Chart Colors Dark.jpeg`, and `assets/Chart Colors Pale.jpeg` — chart-palette reference assets.
- `assets/Peridot Palette Upload Guide 1.png` and `assets/Peridot Palette Upload Guide 2.png` — palette-upload guide/reference assets.
- `assets/2026_Price_Headshot.jpg` — creator portrait used in the Learn More biography flow.
- `assets/Price_CV.pdf` — creator CV resource linked from Learn More.

`src/PeridotHomeWorkspace.jsx` imports the gilded transparent logo directly from `../assets/Peridot Logo Gilded Transparent.png` and the selected filigree from `../assets/Adobe Stock Filigree 1.png`. Keep these files under version control. The local Photoshop source file, `assets/Peridot Logo Workspace.psd`, should remain ignored unless there is an explicit decision to archive editable design sources in the repository.

### Home title-card layout contract

The Home workspace is intentionally a minimal orientation surface rather than a full onboarding page.

Keep:

- the deep green, multi-tone, striped Peridot background;
- the gilded transparent logo;
- the selected licensed gold filigree asset;
- the CTA pair **Use sample data** and **Upload your data**, with **Upload your data** on the right;
- the concise sentence: “Your go-to tool for exploring, visualizing, and presenting humanistic data.”;
- Georgia / Peridot display-serif typography for the sentence;
- non-scrolling first-screen presentation.

Do not:

- add explanatory cards back to the homepage;
- let filigree overlap the logo, sentence, or buttons;
- let button labels wrap;
- let the sentence dominate the Peridot wordmark;
- turn the homepage back into a dashboard/card-grid layout.

Anchor rules:

- the full homepage composition is one centered fixed-ratio title-card stage;
- the logo is the largest visual object and sits left of center;
- the sentence and buttons form one right-side content unit, vertically centered relative to the logo;
- the sentence is centered over the buttons;
- the left filigree frames the outside of the logo group;
- the right filigree frames the outside of the text/buttons group;
- all homepage elements should scale from the same stage sizing logic so the relative proportions remain stable across browser sizes.


### Current Theme and Routing State

The default interface is Peridot-inspired and controlled through semantic roles in `peridotTheme.js`. `peridotThemeRoleMetadata.js` must remain aligned with those roles, while `peridotColorPalette.js` supports older compatibility paths. Chart-targeted palette imports may change chart series only; they must not recolor unrelated interface chrome.

Current routing constraints are stable: the hamburger exposes Manage Your Data, Visualize Your Data, Explore Your Data, and Learn More; Themes and Accessibility remains internally routable but hidden; Export and Timeline stay inside Visualizations; and the persistent rail survives only as a compact Inspector compatibility bridge. For the historical palette and workspace-routing commit sequence, see the Changelog.

## 9. Module Ownership Index

Use this index by subsystem rather than as an alphabetical file list. Module descriptions below remain the current ownership record; detailed behavioral contracts belong in Sections 4–8.

- [Application shell and workspace routing](#application-shell-and-workspace-routing)
- [Data import and mapping](#data-import-and-mapping)
- [Visualizations, map, and timeline](#visualizations-map-and-timeline)
- [Search and interaction resolution](#search-and-interaction-resolution)
- [Analytics](#analytics)
- [Inspector](#inspector)
- [Theme, styles, and visual language](#theme-styles-and-visual-language)
- [Export and shared utilities](#export-and-shared-utilities)

### Application shell and workspace routing

#### `src/App.jsx`

Main orchestration file. It owns top-level state, derived data wiring, workspace composition, theme token definitions, side-panel compatibility contract building, Search & Filter state, timeline state, inspector navigation state, export wiring, the connected-record table renderer, and the live Data workflow. It wires template download, upload parsing, arbitrary CSV/TSV/workbook mapping flow, validation summary state, normalization output, upload-source reset behavior, and modal visibility.

`App.jsx` no longer contains the inline Home, Data, Theme, Visualizations, Explore, Learn More, Search, Export, or hamburger-menu UI components. Those have been extracted into dedicated `Peridot*Workspace` / menu files. It still remains the main state/orchestration boundary.

#### `src/peridotWorkspaceConfig.js`

Workspace-mode vocabulary and helper functions used by `App.jsx` for Home, Data, Visualizations, Explore, Learn More, Search, Inspector, and Themes/Accessibility routing. Export and Timeline are now Visualizations-integrated features rather than standalone workspace modes.

#### `src/PeridotHamburgerMenu.jsx`

Primary visible navigation component. It renders the hamburger button and the simplified task-oriented public menu: Manage Your Data, Visualize Your Data, Explore Your Data, and Learn More about Peridot. Themes and Accessibility is intentionally hidden from the public menu for now, but the component comments preserve the restore point for re-adding that entry later.

#### `src/PeridotHomeWorkspace.jsx`

Full Home / welcome workspace implemented as a fixed-ratio title-card composition. It uses the gilded transparent Peridot logo, licensed filigree framing, a single concise sentence, and **Use sample data** / **Upload your data** calls to action. The component intentionally keeps detailed onboarding out of the homepage; longer explanatory material belongs in `PeridotLearnMoreWorkspace.jsx`.

#### `src/PeridotDataWorkspace.jsx`

Full Data workspace for CSV template download, unified CSV/TSV/XLSX/XLS upload, staged table/workbook summary, mapping launch, latest-upload summary, and navigation to Visualizations.

#### `src/PeridotVisualizationsWorkspace.jsx`

Full Visualizations workspace. It contains capability-aware dropdown groups for mapping, network, chart, and data-exploration views; renders unavailable-state explanations when a dataset cannot support a selected view; hosts the large chart workspace; owns the collapsible visualization header, the bottom Timeline scrubber placement, and the shared header Export menu; and wraps the live map/network stage.

#### `src/PeridotSearchWorkspace.jsx`

Full Advanced Search workspace and primary Explore surface. It renders active-scope summary plus the animated **Build Search**, **Browse**, **Results**, **Refine / Inspect**, and **Capabilities** tabs. It owns the UI for keyword/person/place/route/date/weight filters, predictive suggestions, capability filters, structured AND / OR / EXCLUDING criteria, compact dataset-wide Browse ledgers, route-aware Results ledgers, result facets, Apply Filters, Clear Filters, Explore-scoped page animations, and search-result Inspector handoff. Inspect actions from Explore now open the full Inspector above the current Explore page so the researcher returns to the same tab/state when the Inspector closes.

#### `src/PeridotThemeWorkspace.jsx`

Themes and Accessibility workspace for Peridot default, Early modern map, Modern map presets, custom palette import, role-targeted palette application, and future accessibility/appearance controls. It remains implemented and route-compatible, but the hamburger menu entry is currently hidden while the page remains more development-facing than user-ready. Theme controls should continue to operate through semantic role targets rather than one-off component overrides. Explicit chart-targeted imports should alter chart series colors without recoloring unrelated app chrome.

#### `src/PeridotExploreWorkspace.jsx`

Compatibility routing boundary for the old Explore workspace. Current Explore entry points should route directly to `PeridotSearchWorkspace.jsx`; the former capability-summary role has moved into the Advanced Search **Capabilities** tab.

#### `src/PeridotLearnMoreWorkspace.jsx`

Public project-information hub for creator context, project provenance, open-source resources, AI-method disclosures, tutorials, and help. It keeps compact reading as the default: the creator biography and both disclosure papers expand independently, while the creator/GitHub top row can reallocate width in favor of the longer biography without removing access to repository materials. The creator portrait is part of the expanded biography’s reading flow rather than a separate dashboard card. Major Learn More sections are separated by the same restrained gold-filigree divider language used in Inspector and Explore; divider timing intentionally establishes reading order before each following section appears.

#### `src/PeridotFeedbackForm.jsx`

Persistent feedback modal opened from the control placed beneath the hamburger menu. It owns feedback-type selection, required message validation, optional context/email capture, Formspree submission, success/error states, Cancel/close controls, backdrop behavior, and Escape handling. It is coupled to `PeridotHamburgerMenu.jsx` for entry placement and to `PeridotFeedbackForm.css` for modal layering; its overlay must remain above Visualizations header and stage controls.

### Data import and mapping

#### `src/peridotCsvSchema.js`

Owns the public Peridot CSV schema contract. It defines:

- exact template column names
- field groupings
- minimum record rules
- capability labels
- upload tips
- validation summary copy
- small pure helpers for values, coordinates, person-pair/place-pair checks, mappability, machine-readable dates, accepted-record status, and missing-column checks

This file records the product rule that Peridot is database-first and that missing coordinates/dates should be flagged rather than silently rejecting otherwise useful records.

#### `src/peridotCsvNormalizer.js`

Owns pure conversion from public one-file template rows into the existing internal row shapes. It creates:

- internal geography rows
- internal letter/Inspector metadata rows
- lightweight exact-name person metadata rows
- map-ready places
- accepted/unsupported row groupings

It does not clean or standardize user-entered values.

#### `src/peridotCsvValidation.js`

Owns pure post-upload validation summaries. It produces:

- row-level capability reports
- total uploaded rows
- accepted record counts
- unsupported row counts
- missing-column warnings
- capability counts
- popup-ready summary lines
- persistent side-panel latest-upload summary text

#### `src/PeridotColumnMappingModal.jsx`

Owns the large column/workbook-mapping workspace for arbitrary CSV/TSV/XLSX/XLS imports. The current UI is role-based rather than correspondence-template-first: users move through Preview, Sheets for workbooks, Time, Places, Relations, Evidence, and Review. It still produces Peridot-compatible rows for the existing visualization pipeline, but it now exposes explicit temporal roles, point-location roles, route coordinate-pair roles, workbook primary-sheet selection, multi-sheet unique-ID joins, and selected evidence/Analytics metadata from primary and joined sheets.

This file has been partially decomposed. Static UI labels/step groupings live in `peridotColumnMappingUiConfig.js`; repeated mapping table controls live in `PeridotMappingFieldControls.jsx`; evidence/analysis Include/Ignore controls live in `PeridotEvidenceFieldControls.jsx`. The modal should continue to own state transitions, workbook state, import/cancel behavior, final mapping assembly, upload-mapping entrance animation hooks, and the accepted opacity-only step transition. Avoid reintroducing carousel/slide/scale/blur transitions for step changes unless a new motion pass explicitly chooses that direction.

#### `src/peridotColumnMappingUiConfig.js`

Static UI configuration for the mapping modal: single-table/workbook step sequences, display labels, field groupings, capability labels, and formatting helpers. It intentionally contains no React state and no import/application logic.

#### `src/PeridotMappingFieldControls.jsx`

Presentational mapping-table controls used by the mapping modal for temporal fields, core relationship/place roles, and workbook-aware field-role rows. Workbook role controls now use combined sheet-column selectors rather than stacked Sheet and Column dropdowns, while preserving the internal workbook reference shape. It should remain stateless and receive current values plus callbacks from `PeridotColumnMappingModal.jsx`.

#### `src/PeridotEvidenceFieldControls.jsx`

Presentational evidence/analysis Include/Ignore controls for single-table and workbook imports. Workbook Evidence remains grouped by sheet, but default display labels use the column name only so the sheet name is not duplicated in every label. The modal owns the state and update handlers; this file owns the repeated row rendering, display labels, and checkbox layout.

#### `src/peridotColumnMapping.js`

Owns helper logic for arbitrary table column mapping, including common-name suggestions, core-field mapping rules, temporal-role mapping, point-location role mapping, route coordinate-pair mapping, and selected evidence/Analytics metadata handling. It preserves the existing correspondence-compatible route/network fields while adding role mappings for point/site datasets, start/end/display dates, and latitude-first combined coordinate pairs.

#### `src/peridotWorkbookMapping.js`

Owns workbook-aware mapping and import assembly helpers. It models primary record sheets, sheet/column references, arbitrary unique-ID joins, workbook validation, joined-row context construction, Peridot-shaped row assembly, temporal/point/route role mappings, and selected evidence/Analytics field handling from primary and joined sheets.

#### `src/peridotDataCapabilityAudit.js`

Pure UI-agnostic helper for inspecting uploaded rows and reporting field roles, row capabilities, and dataset-level readiness for Inspector, Search, point maps, route maps, networks, timelines, charts, and export. It supports temporal intervals, latitude-first coordinate pairs, point/site records, route records, time-series-like numeric fields, and generic evidence records.

#### `src/peridotWorkbookParsing.js`

Owns workbook parsing helper logic for CSV, TSV, XLSX, and XLS inputs. It isolates the `xlsx` dependency, parses all sheets into a shared workbook model, ignores formatting/merged-cell styling, and reads saved/displayed cell values only.

#### `src/peridotSampleData.js`

Bundled sample CSV constants used by the Home **Use sample data** path. Keeping sample data out of `App.jsx` reduces top-level orchestration noise and makes future sample replacement safer.

### Visualizations, map, and timeline

#### `src/mapLayoutHelpers.js`

Pure map/layout helper logic, including viewport construction, clustering, cluster radius calculation, label visibility, and geometric calculations.

#### `src/mapStageComponents.jsx`

Map-stage-adjacent UI/chrome components.

#### `src/mapInteractionHandlers.js`

Top-level map interaction handlers.

#### `src/timelinePlaybackHelpers.js`

Pure timeline/playback derivation helpers.

#### `src/timelinePlaybackComponents.jsx`

Timeline/playback panel UI boundary. The timeline is now **year-based**, not month-based.

#### `src/personForceLayoutHelpers.js`

Pure helper logic for the pre-settled force-directed person-network layout.


### Search and interaction resolution

#### `src/interactionHelpers.js`

Pure interaction-resolution and selection-building helpers. This file owns helper logic for nearby candidate generation, selection resolution, cluster selection payload building, connected-correspondent ordering, `person-detail` / `place-detail` payload derivation, Unknown-as-place resolution, person-detail sent/received place-section derivation, and person-graph fallback resolution for related-person navigation from geographic contexts.

### Analytics

#### `src/AnalyticsPanel.jsx`

Owns the Analytics / Chart Visualizations control UI. It renders chart type selection, tabbed Chart/Fields/Categories/Present controls, chart descriptions/example questions, date controls, variable controls, manual category/series selection controls, selection-mode and comparison-total controls, optional presentation-title editing, and the large chart workspace. It preserves compatible chart settings as users switch chart types where possible, defaults Bar Chart orientation to Vertical, and registers chart PNG export with the Visualizations header Export menu rather than rendering a separate export control in the chart rail.

#### `src/analyticsConfig.js`

Owns Analytics chart configuration, including chart labels/descriptions, example research questions, default Analytics state, aggregation options, top-N display options, manual-selection defaults, curated variable definitions, and **Route (Place)** / **Route (Person)** definitions.

#### `src/analyticsDerivationHelpers.js`

Owns Analytics data derivation, including available variable detection, numeric measure detection, conservative filtering of dynamic metadata fields, Year and Full date bucketing, flexible chart data construction, record-count aggregation, manual selected-category filtering, selected-only/Other/dataset-total comparison behavior, grouped/stacked/multi-line count buckets, and semantic alias handling for curated fields such as Language and Relationship.

Dynamic variable detection should exclude technical or non-categorical fields such as IDs, latitude/longitude fields, date fields, mappability flags, object/array values, purely numeric values, long note-like fields, and near-unique row identifiers.

#### `src/analyticsChartComponents.jsx`

Owns SVG chart rendering and shared chart hover tooltip styling for Bar Chart, Grouped Bar Chart, Stacked Bar Chart, Line Chart, Multi-Line Chart, Histogram, Pie Chart, Sunburst Chart, and Heatmap. It also owns shared chart frames, the shared three-quarter chart / one-quarter legend layout, complete simplified summary/legend panels, ranked/segment/line/trend/bin/matrix/slice/sunburst annotation panels, major/minor axis ticks, gridline styling, active theme-series mark colors for every chart type, and the rendered SVG surface used for chart PNG export.

The shared chart tooltip uses a mossy/title-green background with light text for legibility over dense charts such as heatmaps. Axis and panel styling should stay legible against the warm chart-paper background and should not depend on hover-only disclosure for core values. Keep chart-card geometry centralized through the shared layout helper rather than reintroducing unrelated per-chart spacing constants.

### Inspector

#### `src/LeftControlPanel.jsx`

Compact Inspector side-panel shell. Earlier rail/workflow content has been removed. This file now exists primarily to preserve visualization-click Inspector behavior: node, edge, and cluster clicks still open the compact Inspector while deeper evidence navigation routes into the full Inspector workspace.

The old `showRightSidebar` naming remains semantically stale but compatibility-sensitive. Do not rename this path casually; explicitly test node click, edge click, cluster click, contained member navigation, compact close, Expand, and Back behavior before changing it.

#### `src/InspectorPanel.jsx`

Owns inspector content only. It no longer owns the outer panel shell. It renders the inspector header, inspector-internal Back button, and `InspectorBodyRouter`.

#### `src/InspectorBodyRouter.jsx`

Routes resolved inspector state to the appropriate extracted view.

#### `src/InspectorEmptyState.jsx`

Owns the empty inspector state.

#### `src/InspectorClusterView.jsx`

Owns the cluster inspector view. Current behavior groups contained members by place and sorts groups/members by represented visible volume.

#### `src/InspectorEdgeView.jsx`

Owns the edge inspector state boundary.

#### `src/InspectorNodeView.jsx`

Owns the node / person-detail / place-detail inspector boundary. It now renders the scholarly reference-entry Inspector layout: lead summary, optional image/placeholder, compact summary facts, role-grouped connected places and people, directed connections, expandable high-volume lists, selected user-uploaded fields, and connected-record navigation entry points. It also preserves **Unknown** as a place-like bucket when source/target location values are missing or unresolved.

#### `src/InspectorConnectedCorrespondents.jsx`

Inspector navigation component for person-to-person movement.

#### `src/InspectorPersonPlaces.jsx`

Inspector navigation component for person-to-place movement. It shows two explicit sections:

- **Places this person sent letters to**
- **Places where this person received letters**

#### `src/InspectorBackButton.jsx`

Inspector-internal Back button. It uses a small local history model for inspector-internal navigation only and does not track ordinary map clicks as navigation history.

---


### Theme, styles, and visual language

#### `src/peridotTheme.js`

Semantic theme control surface for the whole app. It defines source palettes, custom theme override storage, palette import targets, the finite 30-color default chart series library, semantic role construction, legacy color adaptation, map/network roles, chart roles, navigation chrome roles, timeline roles, search roles, Inspector/search roles, and CSS-variable export. Chart-targeted palette imports should override only `analytics.series`, while the legacy compatibility adapter should not use chart-only overrides to recolor unrelated chrome.

Future color work should start here unless a component genuinely lacks a theme role. Do not scatter new hardcoded colors through chart, Inspector, map, or workspace components when the correct fix is to extend the semantic theme roles.

#### `src/peridotThemeRoleMetadata.js`

Human-facing metadata for theme roles and role groups used by the Themes and Accessibility workspace. This file should stay aligned with `peridotTheme.js` so users can understand what each role controls and so palette imports remain explainable.

#### `src/peridotColorPalette.js`

Legacy compatibility palette adapter. Prefer `peridotTheme.js` for new color work; keep this file available for older component paths that still import legacy tokens.

### Export and shared utilities

#### `src/exportHelpers.js`

Pure export utilities and export row-builder helpers.

## 10. Fragile Zones and Regression Test Matrix



These areas still deserve narrow, explicit passes:

- workspace routing and hamburger-menu behavior
- first-time tutorial progression, target observation, panel placement, minimize/restore state, and workspace/Inspector transitions
- shared `src/index.css` delivery: broad replacements can silently overwrite newer unrelated visual rules; treat small styling work as a source-verified local change rather than a convenience full-file handoff
- map viewport centering/reset behavior
- map/network viewport measurement after switching between Analytics and map/network modes
- dense map hover/click interaction
- selection persistence across filters
- timeline/playback state coupling
- export rendering/state coupling
- broad orchestration work in `src/App.jsx`
- Data upload state, one-file CSV normalization, arbitrary table mapping, workbook parsing helper, and validation summary behavior
- shared side-panel shell and inspector-open interactions
- cluster grouping and cluster inspector navigation
- Analytics expanded overlay positioning and backdrop contrast above the map area
- Analytics dynamic variable detection from uploaded/current row data
- Analytics SVG-to-PNG chart export rendering
- Search & Filter active-dataset state, especially draft/apply coordination across keyword, person, place, route-place, route-people, date, weight, Timeline, Analytics, Inspector, and Export behavior
- archived MapLibre branch work if it is ever explicitly resumed

### Practical regression matrix

| Fragile zone | Typical regression | Minimum test |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace routing | wrong workspace or lost state | Home CTA and every hamburger route |
| First-time tutorial | stalled progression, missing target, obscured control, broken restore, or unstable highlight | launch; all seven stages; Back/Continue; drag; minimize/restore; keyboard; Inspector close; target recovery |
| Inspector bridge | compact Inspector fails to open | node, edge, cluster, contained member, Expand, Back |
| Search scope | results or facets omit/misstate records | draft suggestion, Apply, Clear, pagination, Inspect handoff |
| Timeline / Analytics | stale or inconsistent chart scope | alter timeline/date controls, refresh chart, export |
| Data import | loss of accepted rows or bad joins | template and arbitrary-table import, workbook join, validation |
| Visual stage | remount/reanimation or viewport shift | map/network/chart switch, full Inspector open/close |
| CSS cascade | late stylesheet masks accepted behavior | inspect every extracted workspace and feedback form |
| Chart rendering/export | mismatched labels, colors, or PNG | multiple chart types, manual series, PNG export |
| Theme roles | chart-only changes recolor chrome | apply chart-targeted palette and inspect map/header |
| Export | wrong output scope or broken render | map PNG/SVG, CSV, chart PNG |

## 11. Active Technical Backlog

1. First-time tutorial polish, in bounded passes:
   - attention choreography that sequences dialogue, workspace movement, tutorial placement, and target emphasis;
   - placement audit for panels that obscure important controls;
   - minor typography/spacing refinement;
   - standardized semantic keyword highlighting;
   - final full UX walkthrough.
2. Search coverage and scope audit.
3. Inspector → Advanced Search actions and safe metadata filters, after the coverage audit.
4. Timeline playback × Analytics audit.
5. Accessibility pass.
6. Clarify data-scope language across the app.
7. Learn More completion: substantive research-workflow tutorial/help material.
8. Continue bounded structural work only when a concrete maintenance need exists; `App.jsx` remains concentrated but should not be casually refactored.

For the tutorial polish pass, prefer subtle motion over stronger outlines and explicitly review and refine the order and timing of tutorial-related animations during final visual polish. Do not resurrect the rolled-back animation implementation wholesale.

## 12. Archived and Compatibility Paths



### MapLibre migrated-overlay branch paused / active preview removed

The later `maplibre-native-geographic-view` branch remains an archived experiment. Active `main` no longer contains the dormant MapLibre preview files or dependency after `55a368c`. The removed active-main preview path included `src/MapLibreMapStage.jsx`, `src/mapStyleConfig.js`, and the `maplibre-gl` dependency.

If MapLibre work resumes, begin with a fresh source-of-truth audit and intentionally reintroduce any required package dependencies and stage files. Do not assume the old experiment can be merged directly.

### Shared-panel semantic prop rename

An attempted cleanup of old `showLeftSidebar` / `showRightSidebar` compatibility names was rolled back because it broke inspector auto-open behavior from node, edge, and cluster clicks.

Do not rename this compatibility path casually. If revisited, explicitly test:

- node click opens Inspector
- edge click opens Inspector
- cluster click opens Inspector
- contained cluster member opens detail
- Back behavior still works

### Responsive side-panel sizing

An attempted universal responsive positioning change for the shared side panel was rolled back because it disrupted the normal full-size landscape layout and forced scrolling before the map.

Future responsive work should be a narrow-window-specific override, not a universal replacement of the panel positioning model.

The archived MapLibre branch, legacy side-panel naming, and responsive panel lessons remain relevant only as labeled compatibility/history context. For the complete chronology and all rolled-back records, see the Changelog.

## 13. Fresh-Chat Handoff Essentials



A future chat should start from:

- source of truth folder: `C:\Users\haley\OneDrive\Desktop\Peridot\`
- active branch: `main`
- current synchronized checkpoint: **`619bab0` — `Restore stable tutorial attention behavior`**

A future chat should also be told that:

- the app identity is **Peridot**
- the first-time tutorial is implemented as a seven-stage guided overlay beginning in Visualizations, with draggable/minimizable panels, Back/Continue progression, recovery logic, keyboard accessibility, target highlighting, and explicit Inspector-close guidance; `619bab0` is the stable baseline for future polish
- the user-designed Peridot logo, gilded logo, selected Adobe Stock filigree, homepage screenshot, and homepage mockup assets are stored in `assets/`; the Home workspace uses `assets/Peridot Logo Gilded Transparent.png` and `assets/Adobe Stock Filigree 1.png`; the additional licensed filigree assets `Adobe Stock Filigree 2.png`, `Adobe Stock Filigree 3.png`, `Adobe Stock Filigree Divider Set.png`, and `Adobe Stock Filigree Full Set.png` are retained for design reference/use
- the fixed basemap is `countries50m`
- itch.io packaging support is already committed
- the simplified hamburger/workspace structure is committed; public menu entries are Manage Your Data, Visualize Your Data, Explore Your Data, and Learn More about Peridot; Themes and Accessibility is hidden from public navigation but retained internally; the shared side panel remains primarily as the compact Inspector surface and compatibility bridge
- `InspectorPanel.jsx` is content-only
- `LeftControlPanel.jsx` owns the compact Inspector side-panel shell; Data/Visualizations/Explore/Learn More/Search are public full workspace paths; Themes and Accessibility remains an internal full workspace path; Export and Timeline are Visualizations-integrated
- `peridotCsvSchema.js`, `peridotCsvNormalizer.js`, `peridotCsvValidation.js`, `peridotColumnMapping.js`, `PeridotColumnMappingModal.jsx`, and `peridotWorkbookParsing.js` own the current template upload, arbitrary table mapping, validation, and workbook-helper boundaries
- current cluster, Inspector profile, dual-mode Inspector, linked-letter history, clickable linked people/places, compact summary tile, and route-row features are committed, not deferred
- MapLibre preview code has been removed from active `main`; the migrated-overlay branch remains archived and should not be treated as active implementation direction
- documentation should preserve the full commit trajectory carefully in `CHANGELOG.md`
- the implemented Search & Filter panel consolidates global filtering and defines the active filtered dataset before Analytics, Timeline, Inspector, and Export consume it
- Search & Filter currently uses a compact advanced-search layout with current applied scope at the top
- Data Inputs currently uses a one-file Peridot CSV workflow, arbitrary CSV/TSV mapping, workbook import with unique-ID joins, downloadable template, validation popup, and persistent upload summary
- Chart Visualizations use a large left-controls/right-chart workspace, manual series/category selection, year-default date axes, summary panels, major/minor axis ticks, finite chart colors, higher-contrast tooltips, fit-to-workspace chart rendering, and header-based chart PNG export

Before any source or documentation change, read the current affected source files. Before a core-documentation pass, read the Governance Protocol, restructuring plan, and all four core documents. For process law, use the Project Workflow Charter; for chronology, use the Changelog.
